Malta: The Ultimate AI Launchpad A Strategy and Vision for Artificial Intelligence in Malta 2030 
HON. SILVIO SCHEMBRI
The pace of innovation continues to accelerate. Indeed, 
as artificial intelligence becomes ever-more prevalent and 
intersects across our lives to redefine the man and machine 
relationship, many commentators believe that we are on the 
brink of a revolution on the same scale as the industrial one. 
Clearly then, it is vital for Malta to have the foresight to look 
beyond the present and lay the foundations today to excel in 
tomorrow’s world.
The Strategy and Vision for Artificial Intelligence in Malta aims 
to ensure that benefits brought about by this next wave of 
innovation delivers benefits across all segments of Maltese 
society. At the same time, we need to be vigilant of the risks 
and transformations ahead. 
This requires awareness and understanding amongst the 
general population and business community alike of what AI is 
and why it is important. It necessitates creating trust in how AI 
works in terms of transparency and accountability. 
In developing this strategy, we included an explicit aim to put 
Malta amongst the top 10 nations with the highest impact 
national AI programme. While some of the actions in this 
respect are already well underway – we are launching the 
world’s first national AI certification programme – the fruit of 
other actions will take longer to come to fruition. However, the 
groundwork will commence right away. 
We plan to gradually infuse AI into education, healthcare 
and a range of public services to deliver better services to 
Malta’s citizens and businesses, enhance economic and 
social well-being, and drive operational excellence across 
the public administration. We will do this transparently and 
in consultation with the public and key stakeholders to build 
common understanding, awareness and trust along the way. 
The strategy sets out six AI-related pilot projects to be 
undertaken and we expect more to be identified as we look 
forward.  
We will also be investing heavily in tools and skills to ensure 
that we have the capability to grasp the opportunities ahead. 
The strategy sets out actions to equip all students enrolled 
in higher education programmes in Malta with AI skills and 
knowledge. Scholarships and personal tax incentives will be 
used to leverage and increase the number of post-graduate 
AI specialists. 
Our current workforce will not be left behind. We will be 
setting up a think tank, together with key stakeholders and 
social partners, to understand and plan for the impact of 
technology and automation across the wider Maltese labour 
market. In conjunction, we will also assist vulnerable workers 
to develop new digital skills and give due focus to supporting 
life-long learning and upskilling activities. We will also invest 
in developing language tools to enable us to communicate 
with our digital devices in Maltese, just as seamlessly as we 
currently do in English. 
Our vision is for Malta to become the “Ultimate AI Launchpad”. 
We expect this strategy to catalyse R&D and innovation 
across the country. We will look to set up regulatory and data 
sandboxes for AI to help companies test innovative concepts 
and solutions in a contained environment with proportionate 
safeguards. We want to build a vibrant start-up community and 
encourage its members to collaborate with local businesses 
looking to infuse AI into their operations. 
We want AI to help Malta’s citizens and businesses get ahead 
and as a government we will do all we can to do so. We are 
committed to pursuing the Malta AI Strategy and Vision in 
partnership with our country’s citizens. Conscious that this is a 
new area, we shall nurture dialogue to ensure that stakeholders 
can ask questions, voice concerns and make recommendations 
as we take this strategy forward. 
In conclusion, I would like to express my gratitude to 
the Malta.AI Taskforce, Working Groups, and all the 
stakeholders and individuals who contributed to the 
development of this strategy. I look forward to your 
support in working towards our vision. 
Parliamentary Secretary for Financial Services,

A Strategy and Vision for Artificial Intelligence in Malta 2030 
WAYNE GRIXTI
Few would dispute that technology is becoming ever more 
intertwined with our daily lives. Yet it appears we are only 
starting to scratch the surface of what is to come over the next 
two decades. Artificial intelligence AI is expected to become 
the most important and transformative general-purpose 
technology GPT of our era and radically alter our way of life, 
both economically and socially, as the wheel, electricity, cars, 
computers and the internet did in the past.
Throughout 2019, the Malta.AI Taskforce and Working Groups 
have worked hard to develop a National AI Strategy that aims 
to create a lasting and positive impact on Malta’s citizens and 
businesses. This is just the beginning of Malta’s journey into 
this exciting new era, but already, in some aspects, we are well 
ahead of the game. 
In 1995, Malta launched one of the first AI degree programmes 
in Europe and has steadily built up AI expertise over the years. 
Last year, the country became a pioneer in its creation of 
the Malta Digital Innovation Authority (MDIA), a regulatory 
authority responsible for governmental policies aimed at 
positioning Malta as a centre for excellence and innovation 
across digital technologies. 
In parallel with the launch of strategy, Malta has published its 
ethical AI Framework, Towards Trustworthy AI. The document 
builds on the work of various international bodies and 
organisations and establishes a set of guiding principles and 
trustworthy AI governance and control mechanisms to guide 
AI practitioners on how to design, train and operate AI in a 
trusted and ethical manner. 
Taking a further leap forward, the MDIA will publish guidelines 
for the world’s first national AI certification programme. The 
programme will be voluntary, at least initially, and aims to 
provide applicants with valuable recognition in the marketplace 
that their AI systems have been developed in an ethically aligned, 
transparent and socially responsible manner. Certification will 
be awarded following a thorough audit process undertaken 
by independent experts authorised by the MDIA. We expect 
that many nations will look to follow our lead in this respect. 
On behalf of both the Malta.AI Taskforce and the MDIA, we 
would welcome the opportunity to share our experiences and 
knowledge with you. 
Collaboration will be a central theme that underpins Malta’s 
AI ecosystem as we take this strategy forward together with 
Malta’s citizens and businesses. As a small country, we want to 
team, share and co-innovate with governments, organisations, 
researchers, tech entrepreneurs and pioneers from around 
the world to explore, showcase and champion the benefits 
that AI can deliver. 
Our aspiration is for Malta to become the “Ultimate AI Launchpad” 
– a place in which local and foreign companies, and entrepreneurs, 
can develop, prototype, test and scale AI, and ultimately showcase 
the value of their innovations across an entire nation primed 
for adoption. Our ambition is to create the conditions for AI to 
springboard from Malta to the rest of the world.
We are not there yet, with much work still to be done. I 
therefore ask for your support in helping us take this strategy 
and its actions forward over the coming years. The MDIA 
has been tasked with the responsibility for the monitoring 
and governance of the strategy’s implementation, and, as 
its Chief Technology Officer, I will continue to be involved. I 
look forward to working with Malta’s stakeholders to turn our 
vision into a reality.

A Strategy and Vision for Artificial Intelligence in Malta 2030 
A Strategy and Vision for Artificial Intelligence in Malta 2030 aims 
to map the path for Malta to gain a strategic competitive 
advantage in the global economy as a leader in the AI field. 
The Strategy is expansive, looking at the impact 
commercially and socially, areas of economic opportunity 
and the need for special consideration, if not regulation, 
where AI use cases potentially intersect with national 
priorities, values and citizen’s rights. 
The Strategy has been built on the following three 
strategic pillars:
Investment, start-ups and innovation: sets out 
initiatives to generate investment and position the 
country as a hub for AI application and niche areas of 
research and development, supported by a vibrant start-
up community. 
Public sector adoption: explores how AI can be 
deployed widely across the public administration to 
improve citizens’ experiences, expand access to public 
services, and directly improve well-being. Six AI pilot 
projects covering traffic management, education, 
health, customer service, tourism, and utilities will be 
undertaken over the coming three years. 
Private sector adoption: details initiatives to drive 
awareness and enable companies of all sizes to use, 
develop and integrate AI applications across their 
organisations. Support measures include access to 
technological expertise, the provision of toolkits and 
financial assistance. 
Each pillar draws on three strategic enablers:
Education and workforce: plans for the impact of 
technology and automation on the Maltese labour market 
and proposes measures to assist workers to develop new 
digital skills, increase the number of AI specialists and equip 
all students on higher education programmes in Malta with 
AI knowledge. 
Ethical and legal: establishes the world’s first national 
AI certification programme to provide a platform to 
practitioners and companies that wish to showcase 
ethically aligned, transparent and socially responsible AI 
solutions, building on Malta’s Ethical AI Framework Towards 
Trustworthy AI. It makes provision for the formation of 
a Technology Regulation Advisory Committee to advise 
on laws and regulation in respect to AI matters and the 
creation of regulatory and data sandboxes. 
Ecosystem infrastructure: lays out investments in tools to 
enable Maltese Language AI solutions, initiatives to support 
data availability and actions to mitigate cybersecurity risks 
and facilitate cost-effective access to high-performance 
compute capability among other measures designed to 
create the underlying infrastructure to support a thriving 
AI ecosystem.  
The document sets a vision for Malta to become the 
“Ultimate AI Launchpad” by 2030 and a Strategy, 
supported by a series of actions to be undertaken 
between 2019-2022 to lay the foundations to get there.

INTRODUCTION AND 
BACKGROUND
CHAPTER 1
What is AI?
• After more than six decades as an academic discipline, 
and several cycles of hope, hype and decline, the field of 
artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged from the laboratory 
as a science project into a more consumable, commercially 
viable and socially impactful technological innovation.
• Defining what AI actually is remains challenging. Experts 
have not yet reached an agreement on the matter, so AI has 
many different definitions which are constantly evolving. 
The reason for this is that AI consists of a wide range of 
technologies, scientific approaches and definitions which 
are simultaneously being researched, discovered and 
taken forward to expand what is possible.
• The European Commission’s AI HLEG published A definition 
of Artificial Intelligence: main capabilities and scientific 
discipline in December 20181. This seven-page document 
opened with a disclaimer: “The following description and 
definition of AI capabilities and research areas is a very 
crude oversimplification of the state of the art. The intent 
of this document is not to precisely and comprehensively 
define all AI techniques and capabilities, but to describe 
summarily the joint understanding of this discipline that 
the High-Level Expert Group is using in its deliverables”.
• The definition provided in the document states: “Artificial 
intelligence (AI) refers to systems designed by humans that, 
given a complex goal, act in the physical or digital world 
by perceiving their environment, interpreting the collected 
structured or unstructured data, reasoning on the knowledge 
derived from this data and deciding the best action(s) to take 
(according to predefined parameters) to achieve the given 
goal. AI systems can also be designed to learn to adapt their 
behaviour by analysing how the environment is affected by 
their previous actions. As a scientific discipline, AI includes 
several approaches and techniques, such as machine 
learning (of which deep learning and reinforcement learning 
are specific examples), machine reasoning (which includes 
planning, scheduling, knowledge representation and 
reasoning, search and optimisation), and robotics (which 
includes control, perception, sensors and actuators, as well 
as the integration of all other techniques into cyber-physical 
systems).”
• Put simply, AI uses data and algorithms (a set of 
instructions using mathematical formulae) on computers 
or other technological systems to perform specific tasks 
or make decisions that usually require human intelligence, 
such as learning, problem solving, pattern recognition, 
visual perception and speech recognition. Trained AI can 
perform these tasks or make these decisions without 
explicit human instructions using a series of techniques 
and technologies.

A Strategy and Vision for Artificial Intelligence in Malta 2030 
• Most of us interact with AI-based systems on a daily basis 
without paying too much attention to them. Common 
applications that embed AI technologies include search 
engines, virtual voice assistants, spam filters, websites 
with online shopping recommendations, and social media 
channels.
• Although most commonly software application based, such 
as on smart phones and computers, AI technologies can 
also be embedded into other physical hardware devices 
such as drones, autonomous cars and robotics.
How intelligent is AI?
• AI has sparked existential debates on the fate of humanity. 
In 2014, the late Stephen Hawking stirred controversy when 
he told the BBC that: “The development of full artificial 
intelligence could spell the end of the human race2.”
• His reference to “full” relates to the distinction between 
general and narrow intelligence. Humans learn and 
apply such learnings across domains: in other words, the 
human brain can “generalise” knowledge gained from a 
single experience and apply such knowledge to different 
experiences in entirely different contexts.
• Machines are not yet able to replicate this deeply human 
skill. Even the “smartest” and most powerful AI systems 
today, which can outperform humans in a specific task, 
such as playing a particular game or diagnosing a certain 
type of cancer, are not able to generalise knowledge 
beyond a specific task and context. Therefore, they are 
often called “narrow AI.”
• While it may be possible, in the distant future, for human 
engineers to architect an AI that can demonstrate a more 
general intelligence, no currently available system can or 
will evolve, organically, to become full or general.
• Consequently, this future scenario in which machines 
“generally” outthink humans to become a threat to 
humanity itself is not a practical scenario and has limited 
utility for public policy makers.
• Rather, discussions about the rise of sentient AI are 
proper topics for academic circles, future-focused think 
tanks and Hollywood producers. They are otherwise a 
distraction from the real and current risks of AI that must 
be understood and considered by public policy makers.
• A more pragmatic threat worthy of policy consideration 
is how humans may corrupt or misapply this technology. 
Policy makers should also predict and influence how AI 
might change governance, society, health, work and other 
aspects of life.

could end mankind. BBC News. [online] Available at: https://www.bbc.com/news/

Why does AI matter?
• AI is widely considered to be a general purpose technology. 
In other words, it has functions and characteristics 
which can generate and spread incremental and radical 
innovation and business growth across different fields, 
activities and sectors.
• Research conducted on behalf of the World Economic Forum3 
highlighted that AI is projected to underpin close to 14 trillion 
of global economic growth by 2030 and drive significant 
productivity gains, if not transform how businesses operate, 
across all sectors of the global economy.
• Though the timeline and nature of impact will play out 
differently across sectors and countries, AI is expected to 
make a noticeable difference to each and every one of us. 
Beyond the workplace and industry, AI will also transform 
the way we live and play.
• There have been fewer than 30 general purpose 
technologies4 throughout human history. The wheel, the 
internal combustion engine, electricity, cars, computers 
and the internet are amongst them. AI has now joined this 
exclusive set of historical milestones, highlighting just how 
big the impact is expected to be.
• Some of AI’s most impactful applications revolve around 
how it can be used to achieve positive outcomes for society:
 · In the healthcare field, extensive work is underway 
to use AI to detect and diagnose various forms of 
cancer, monitor health and provide individuals with 
personalised treatment plans
 · Various countries are using AI to help prevent traffic 
jams and manage traffic flows, thereby reducing 
travel times and decreasing emissions
 · In the education field, AI is being used to help 
teachers provide feedback on students’ homework, 
enhance early childhood vocabulary development, 
learn and practice foreign languages, and assist 
with personalised learning content outside the 
classroom
 · In some countries, farmers are deploying AI systems 
to identify pests, diseases and nutritional deficiencies 
in crops and to determine water and fertiliser needs 
accurately, thereby reducing costs, improving yields 
and decreasing pesticide usage

Why are some people concerned?
• The benefits that AI will bring about are vast, but the 
technology also creates various risks that need to be 
addressed and appropriately managed.
• AI raises profound questions across ethical, legal and 
regulatory domains, touching a range of areas from 
protecting national security and citizen rights to advancing 
commercial interests and international standing. These 
include the risks of biased and unaccountable automated 
decision-making, discrimination, data privacy-related 
issues, cyber threats and the potential for manipulation of 
political systems and wider society in general. 
• Various nations, international organisations, standards 
agencies and bodies are developing research, principles, 
guidelines, standards and control frameworks aimed at 
enhancing trust and ethics in the design, deployment and 
use of AI systems. 
• The potential for technological job displacement is also 
a major concern for policy makers. Various studies have 
been undertaken by academics, research institutes 
and government bodies on the potential impact that 
automation will have on the workforce, but there appears 
to be little consensus on both the number of jobs at high 
risk from automation and the number of new jobs that are 
expected to be created by the technology. 
• One of the most widely quoted and influential studies 
was conducted by Carl Frey and Michael Osborne from 
Oxford University in 2013. It forecast that around 47% of 
jobs in the US were at high risk of being automated5 from a 
’technologically capable’ perspective. 
• Numerous other studies on the topic have since been 
undertaken, including one by the OECD6, which expanded 
on this work by examining all the tasks that workers carry 
out across their jobs. The research put the US figure at 10% 
and 12% for all OECD nations. It also highlighted that the 
variance in automatability across countries is large, with 
33% of all jobs in a Central European country deemed to 
be highly automatable, compared with only 6% of the jobs 
in a country in the Nordics. 
• A 2018 study by Accenture estimated that: “If companies 
were to invest in AI and human-machine collaboration at 
the same level as the top-performing fifth of companies 
globally, they could boost revenues by 38% and lift 
employment levels by 10% between 2018 and 2022.”7 The 
World Economic Forum estimates that automation will 
displace 75 million jobs but generate 133 million new ones 
worldwide by 2022 in The Future of Jobs Report 20188.

A Strategy and Vision for Artificial Intelligence in Malta 2030 
• EY’s recent report, The Future of Work, highlights how 
difficult it is to forecast the nature and impact of 
technology on jobs. It outlines how studies may overstate 
the extent of machine substitution for human labour due 
to a lack of useful and accurate data, or understate the 
strong complementary role of automation in boosting 
productivity and employment. The report does, however, 
stress that a counter-scenario could play out in which 
sudden shock job losses occur in the short term. Its key 
message stresses that policy actions should be a national 
imperative to ensure workers get future-ready and quickly 
acquire the new skills needed to adapt this changing world 
as the pace of change accelerates over the next decade9.   
AI in the EU
• In April 2018, the European Commission published the 
Communication on Artificial Intelligence for Europe10, a 20-
page document that lays out the EU’s approach to AI, to 
ensure that Member States work together on the most 
important issues relating to AI to ensure that:
 · Europe is competitive in the AI landscape
 · No one is left behind in the digital transformation
 · New technologies are based on values
• The Communication on Artificial Intelligence for Europe sets 
out a European initiative on AI which aims to:
 · Boost the EU’s technological and industrial capacity 
and AI uptake across the economy
 · Prepare for socio-economic changes brought about 
by AI
 · Ensure an appropriate ethical and legal framework
• The Communication sets out how €1.5 billion will be 
made available to support AI research between 2018 and 
2020, with the EU having already invested €1.1 billion in 
AI-related research under the Horizon 2020 research and 
innovation programme between 2014 and 2017. 
• The European Commission also established the European 
AI Alliance as a multi-stakeholder forum for engaging in a 
broad and open discussion of all aspects of AI development 
and its impact on the economy and society. It is steered by 
the AI HLEG, which consists of 52 experts who have been 
selected by the European Commission for this task. 
• The AI HLEG has a general objective to support the 
implementation of the European Strategy on Artificial 
Intelligence. This includes making recommendations on 
future-related policy development and on ethical, legal 
and societal issues related to AI, including socio-economic 
challenges11.

• The European Commission worked with Member States, 
including Malta, to develop the Coordinated Plan on Artificial 
Intelligence12, which was published in December 2018. The 
goal of the plan is to “maximise the impact of investments 
at EU and national levels, encourage synergies and 
cooperation across the EU, exchange best practices and 
collectively define the way forward to ensure that the EU 
can compete globally.”
• This plan proposes joint actions for closer and more 
efficient cooperation between Member States, Norway, 
Switzerland and the European Commission in four key 
areas: to increase investment, make more data available, 
foster talent and ensure trust. 
• As part of this process, all Member States were asked to 
develop national AI strategies which address the countries’ 
specific priorities. Some of these strategies have been 
published and others are expected in 2019. 
• The European Parliament and the Council of the European 
Union reached a provisional political agreement in 
February 2019 on the first ever Digital Europe Programme, 
which will see €9.2 billion invested between 2021 and 
202713 across five key digital areas14: 
 · €2.7 billion to build up, strengthen and increase 
accessibility to supercomputing
 · €2.5 billion to invest in and drive adoption of 
AI by businesses and public administrations; 
facilitate safe access to and storage of large data 
sets and algorithms; and strengthen testing and 
experimentation facilities 
 · €2 billion to support the procurement, development 
and deployment of advanced cybersecurity equipment, 
tools, data infrastructures and knowledge
 · €700 million to support the current and future 
workforce in EU countries, including Malta, to 
acquire advanced digital skills through long- and 
short-term training courses and on-the-job training 
and traineeships
 · €1.3 billion to support the wide use of digital 
technologies across the economy and society, 
including the public sector and areas of public 
interests, such as healthcare, education, transport, 
and the cultural and creative sectors

Malta: The Ultimate AI Launchpad A Strategy and Vision for Artificial Intelligence in Malta 2030 
What are the opportunities for Malta?
• Located in the centre of the Mediterranean, the Maltese 
islands have been a major regional trading hub throughout 
their history. Moreover, a strategic location, a clear 
political commitment to ensure sustainable economic 
development, and a highly qualified workforce, has 
ensured that the country is increasingly respected as an 
attractive investment location.
• Malta’s economy has seen significant transformation 
across the last 15 years, and its GDP has more than 
doubled across this period15. Over the last five years, Malta 
has been one of the fastest-growing economies in the 
eurozone. Malta’s economy grew by 6.7% in 2018, making it 
the fifth year in a row in which real GDP has grown by over 
5%. The outlook for strong growth looks set to continue, 
with real GDP growth forecasted to be 5.3% in 2019 and 
4.8% in 202016. 
• Malta joined the EU in 2004 and became a member of the 
eurozone in 2008. It also transformed its economic focus, 
shifting from low-end manufacturing to an innovation-
driven, service-based economy which is recognised as a 
leading global hub for financial and digital industries, with 
a re-dimensioned focus on industry aligned to advanced 
manufacturing, maritime and aviation service, together 
with significant growth in tourism, construction and real 
estate. 
• The continued diversification of Malta’s economy into new 
areas is important as the global economy continues to 
transform. Last year, the country became a pioneer in its 
creation of the Malta Digital Innovation Authority (MDIA), a 
regulatory authority responsible for governmental policies 
aimed at positioning Malta as a centre for excellence and 
innovation across digital technologies. 
• The Government of Malta has taken a clear stance on 
technological innovation: it should be embraced, not 
stifled; Malta should be a disrupter, rather than a follower. 
In line with this commitment, Malta firmly established 
itself as a leader in new, up-and-coming areas such as 
distributed ledger technology (DLT) and gained global 
recognition as the “Blockchain Island”. The country has 
now set out to establish itself in the fields of AI. 
• AI solutions will enable companies to enhance operational 
performance and deliver better services to their customers. 
This is especially relevant in a tight labour market such as 
Malta’s.
• Malta’s key sectors are well suited to adopt AI solutions 
as companies look to innovate to provide competitive 
differentiation and drive operational improvements. Set 
out below is some examples of how AI is being used in 
these industries, either in Malta or globally:

 · Financial services: AI-driven based solutions 
are being used for intelligent financial planning, 
investment and money management services 
for consumers. They are also helping financial 
institutions create smarter credit and risk 
analysis applications and streamline operational 
performance.
 · Gaming: AI technologies are frequently incorporated 
into solutions to help detect and reduce fraud, 
enhance marketing effectiveness, and augment 
customer service interactions and customer 
experience functions. 
 · Advanced manufacturing and aviation 
maintenance, repair and overhaul industries: 
AI-driven solutions are being deployed for condition 
monitoring and predictive maintenance activities. 
The solutions draw on the vast amount of data that 
aircraft, ships and machines now generate.
 · Tourism: AI models are being applied to big data 
to discover industry trends and sentiment (i.e. 
what tourists like and dislike) at scale, provide 
recommendations on places to visit and book, and 
enable hotels and vacation rental owners to deploy 
automated pricing solutions based on supply and 
demand. 
 · Real estate: AI solutions are being used to 
increase the relevance of recommendations users 
see on websites, display personalised advertising, 
identify when new properties come on the market, 
and automatically tag and classify property photos 
and listings.
• Global technology companies are making significant 
investments in AI and opening new AI hubs in international 
locations; sometimes in partnership with universities, 
countries and cities. Companies and research organisations 
are actively seeking out high-profile use cases to pilot 
and showcase AI projects. National projects are highly 
attractive, and Malta’s size makes it a viable test bed for 
pilot projects which can be run across an entire country. 
• Malta can leverage its natural resources and size, as well 
as innovative public policy, to translate a bold leadership 
vision into a set of tools, incentives, resources and 
collaborative ecosystems that accelerate the journey from 
AI development to AI adoption, leading to commercial 
success, social benefit and international recognition.
Malta: The Ultimate AI Launchpad
13
A Strategy and Vision for Artificial Intelligence in Malta 2030 
• Countries have an opportunity to differentiate themselves 
through strong policy actions that address ethical, 
regulatory and legal dilemmas brought about by AI. Malta 
has taken a global lead by developing the world’s first 
national AI certification programme. The certification 
process will largely be based on Malta’s Ethical AI 
Framework, Towards Trustworthy AI17 and aims to provide 
applicants with valuable recognition in the marketplace 
that their AI systems have been developed in an ethically 
aligned, responsible and trustworthy manner. 
• While a handful of large countries can out-invest and 
out-build others, the nature of AI development makes 
it possible for a single company or academic lab to put 
a small country on the map, even to lead and drive the 
agenda in one branch of AI.
Malta – Towards an AI Strategy 
• In November 2018, the Parliamentary Secretary for Financial 
Services, Digital Economy and Innovation appointed the Malta.
AI Taskforce with the remit of advising the Government and 
developing a national strategy on AI (hereafter also referred 
to as the Strategy, the National AI Strategy and the Malta AI 
Strategy). The Malta.AI Taskforce members include a diverse 
set of some of the country’s best minds in entrepreneurship, 
academia, public policy, technology strategy, law and data 
science. Working groups were also formed to address the 
various areas of focus for the Malta AI Strategy.
• In March 2019, the Malta.AI Taskforce published a high-
level policy document, Malta – Towards an AI Strategy18. The 
document laid out the blueprint and the key areas of focus 
for the National AI Strategy.
• The Government’s aim was to develop a National AI 
Strategy that focuses investment, resources and attention 
in ways that maximise the benefits for Malta and its 
contributions to the global economy. 
• To realise this vision, the Malta.AI Taskforce and working 
groups engaged with a broad spectrum of stakeholders, 
aiming to be inclusive and build awareness of the key topics 
and issues that should be addressed through the Strategy 
and formulate AI policies that are consistent with emerging 
international standards and norms around AI ethics. 
• The comments received during the consultation were 
supportive of the direction and areas of focus set in the 
high-level policy document Malta – Towards an AI Strategy, 
and the national strategy has therefore built on these 
areas to set out a number of actions that will be achieved 
by 2022, together with actions to support a longer-term 
vision of where the country would like to be in 2030.

A Strategy and Vision for Artificial Intelligence in Malta 2030 
Malta – the “Ultimate AI Launchpad”
Malta aspires to become the “Ultimate AI 
Launchpad”- a place in which local and 
foreign companies and entrepreneurs can 
develop, prototype, test and scale AI, and 
ultimately showcase the value of their 
innovations across an entire nation primed 
for adoption. The ambition is to create 
the conditions for AI to springboard from 
Malta to the world.
Goals – where will we be?
The table overleaf sets out aspirational goals for Malta to achieve between 2019 and 2022 through 
the actions and policy measures detailed in the following chapters. The corresponding 2030 vision is 
the longer-term outlook of where Malta hopes to get to as it builds on the groundwork and actions 
of the Strategy.

Malta’s benefits as a launchpad for AI
• With its small population of just under half a million inhabitants, the entire nation, rather than a town 
or city, becomes the ultimate AI pilot site.
• Malta is an EU Member State with a tech-savvy population, and English is one of the country’s two 
official national languages. 
• Its local laws and regulatory frameworks are specifically designed to promote the adoption and use 
of innovative technologies. 
• The country has a strong and rapidly growing economy and a stable and business-friendly regulatory 
environment across telecommunications, gaming, financial services and fintech, which is conducive 
for trials and nurtures innovation.
• Malta’s telecommunications infrastructure is amongst the most advanced in Europe, with high 
mobile and high-speed broadband penetration rates and 5G-ready infrastructure in place.
• The Maltese government is committed to creating the conditions for a robust local AI ecosystem, 
helping companies that invest in and serve Malta not only to establish their businesses but also to 
commercialise and scale. Public policy is also used to accelerate private sector adoption of AI.
• The Maltese telecoms regulator already operates a test-and-trial licensing scheme in support 
of innovative spectrum uses which aim to exploit Malta’s unique potential as a test bed, both for 
technology tests and service trials involving third parties or the public.
• Leading global telecommunications companies have agreements in place with the Government to 
use the island as a test bed for digital technologies.  
• Malta will look to set up a Regulatory Sandbox for AI to enable firms to explore and test concepts and 
solutions with proportionate safeguards, in a contained environment for a well-defined duration. 
• The national data protection authority will also set up a Data Sandbox to support organisations that 
need to use personal data in the process of developing or testing innovative products and services 
in the specific area of AI. 
• The country is keen to work with and collaborate with companies of all sizes, nations, international 
bodies and research organisations to accelerate the AI agenda. 
Malta: The Ultimate AI Launchpad
19
A Strategy and Vision for Artificial Intelligence in Malta 2030 
AI is expected to have a transformative impact across multiple 
areas of society, government and business. The Strategy and 
Vision for Artificial Intelligence in Malta 2030 therefore takes a 
holistic approach and aims to give due focus to the needs of 
various different groups of stakeholders as the country looks 
forward to achieving its vision. 
The Strategy includes three vertical pillars which focus 
on boosting investment, innovation and adoption. It also 
includes three horizontal enablers that cut across the three 
aforementioned areas. Its wide-reaching nature ensures it is 
inclusive and does not leave any segment of society unduly 
burdened or left behind. 
Strategy implementation and governance 
• Effective governance will be critical for the successful implementation and achievement of the Strategy. 
• Each action set-out in this document has been jointly developed with relevant stakeholders, who will now have responsibility to 
take them forward. 
• The Malta Digital Innovation Authority (MDIA) will be responsible for the oversight and governance of the Strategy, in accordance 
with the functions vested to it under the MDIA Act. The MDIA will work with each stakeholder to agree on key implementation 
milestones and monitoring mechanisms for areas and actions they are responsible for.

INVESTMENT, START-UPS 
AND INNOVATION
CHAPTER 3
Malta: The Ultimate AI Launchpad
21
A Strategy and Vision for Artificial Intelligence in Malta 2030 
Innovation is at the heart of the Malta AI Strategy. This is 
deeply interlinked with investment and economic activity from 
both local and foreign businesses, increased expenditure on 
Research and Development (R&D) and the creation of new 
start-up enterprises. 
Malta will seek to attract and develop talent, drive investment 
and incubate an innovation ecosystem that will allow the AI 
sector to flourish. Economic development has therefore been 
set out as a primary objective and key focus of the Strategy. 
The Government will look to nurture, attract and welcome 
companies of all sizes across all industries, from start-ups to 
scale-ups to established global tech leaders. 
Establish the right conditions for Malta to 
become a leading centre for the application of 
AI solutions 
• AI is a broad field with many branches and sub-branches. 
The limitless scope of application means that there 
are many niches that can be explored, showcased and 
championed. While Malta’s inherent limitations make 
it challenging for the country to become a leader across 
every field of AI, it can be a model nation focused on 
excelling in the application of AI across specific fields.
01 The Maltese Government wants to collaborate with 
researchers, start-ups and companies that wish to use 
Malta to pilot and deploy AI solutions. It has created an 
interface for interested parties to submit a proposal 
and request a meeting with government officials at 
www.malta.ai.  
02 The Government also will fund the development of a 
digital collaboration platform which will allow it, as well as 
research institutes and the private sector, to publish project 
profiles, collaboration requests, innovation challenges 
and requests for information (RFIs). Once complete, the 
collaboration platform will be the digital hub of Malta’s AI 
activity, showcasing the volume of AI opportunities in Malta 
and facilitating opportunities for local and international 
start-ups, corporates and research organisations to tap 
into and work together.
03 The Maltese Government has placed the development of 
new emerging technological sectors such as AI as a national 
priority. Through Tech.mt, a public-private foundation 
tasked with promoting Malta as a leading global hub for 
emerging technologies, including AI, the Government will 
provide €1m per annum in funding to raise the visibility of 
the country’s offering and promote Maltese AI businesses 
through various marketing activities, with participation in 
and sponsorship of leading global AI and tech summits in 
Malta and overseas. 
Increase R&D activity in Malta
• R&D is a major driver of innovation and helps new products 
and services to be brought to the market. Malta is taking a 
multi-pronged approach to increase R&D intensity as a key 
focal area of the National AI Strategy. 
04 In 2019, Malta introduced a Patent Box Regime (Deduction) 
enabling qualifying beneficiaries to benefit from a deduction 
against taxable income or gains of up to 95% of the gross 
revenue from its qualifying intellectual property (IP) assets. 
This measure is expected to significantly strengthen Malta’s 
positioning as the “Ultimate AI Launchpad” and stimulate 
AI related R&D activities in the country. 
05 The country will also invest to strengthen its AI research 
capabilities at two of its public higher education institutes, 
the University of Malta (UoM) and the Malta College of Arts, 
Science & Technology (MCAST), to increase academic and 
applied research output and drive greater collaboration 
with industry and international partners. Further details 
on these initiatives are provided on p.41.
06 Financial support will be provided for AI-related research 
commercialisation programmes and technology 
development (including financial support for research, 
development and innovation) in Malta’s areas of Smart 
Specialisation (ICT as an Enabler, ICT Based Innovation, 
Tourism Product Development, Aviation and Aerospace, 
Health, Resource Efficient Buildings, High Value-Added 
Manufacturing, Aquaculture) through the Malta Council for 
Science and Technology (MCST) R&I FUSION Programme 
until 2020. The annual budget currently allocated to the 
R&I FUSION Programme is €2.2m. 
07 Malta Enterprise, the Economic Development Agency of 
the Maltese Government, has launched a set of incentives 
which aim to support companies of various sizes in R&D 
and innovation activities. These measures include financial 
assistance (in the form of tax credits) to undertake R&D 
projects; employ those holding or undertaking doctoral 
degrees; and support SMEs in temporarily engaging highly 
qualified personnel from large businesses and research 
organisations for specific projects. 
Investment, start-ups and innovation
22
Malta: The Ultimate AI Launchpad A Strategy and Vision for Artificial Intelligence in Malta 2030 
• Malta has invested heavily in infrastructure and legislation 
to be well positioned to become a leader in health-related 
AI research. The country’s health information system is 
fully centralised and its Directorate for Health Information 
and Research (DHIR) holds extensive registers and data 
repositories (most dating back 10 or 20 years) with set 
variables around specific diseases or life events. The 
unique records permit linkage between registers and public 
datasets to create an infinite combination of data variables 
which are anonymised or pseudonymised for release to 
third parties for public interest research purposes. 
08 The government will shortly introduce a new legal notice 
which regulates the secondary processing of personal data 
in the health sector, as allowed for and specified within the 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), for matters 
pertaining public health, health services management, 
health statistics and research. The legal notice lays out 
conditions and safeguards and provides for a clear 
approval mechanism for health research through Malta’s 
Health Ethics Committee or any other Ethics Committee 
recognised by the Information and Data Protection 
Commissioner.
Support entrepreneurs to establish AI-related 
business ventures and scale
• Start-ups bolster the business community, drive innovation 
and R&D, stimulate competition and introduce new 
products, services and business models into the market. 
Yet starting a new business is not easy, and entrepreneurs 
often need support to get their business off the ground. 
The Maltese Government will therefore be implementing 
a series of policy actions to catalyse, synergise and boost 
start-up activity in the country. 
Accelerators
09 The Government will seek to partner with an internationally 
renowned start-up accelerator to run a programme in 
Malta. The initiative is expected to provide participants 
with seed investment, connections, mentorship and 
hands-on support to build business, product and fund-
raising strategies. The programme will conclude with a 
demo day, where participants will have the opportunity to 
pitch their business to investors who can help accelerate 
their companies’ growth. Applications are expected to be 
open to both local and foreign companies focusing on AI 
and other emerging technologies. 
10 YouStartIT, a well-established, early stage accelerator 
programme run by the MITA Innovation Hub, will be given 
additional funding to run a thematic AI-based programme, 
thereby increasing its cohort to two programmes per 
year. As part of its offering, it will provide zero-equity 
investments (seed capital grants) to help early stage start-
ups to validate and develop proof of concepts for AI-based 
ventures.
11 The TAKEOFF Seed Fund Award (TOFSA) will be given 
additional funding to support AI ventures over and above 
its current allocation. TOFSA is a joint initiative between the 
Ministry for the Economy, Investment and Small Businesses, 
the University of Malta (UoM) and its Knowledge Transfer 
Office, TAKEOFF Business Incubator and the Centre 
for Entrepreneurship and Business Incubation, which 
provides seed funding to researchers and entrepreneurs. 
Under the programme, TOFSA awards funds through a 
two-step process, whereby the best-written applications 
are shortlisted for a live pitch in front of a panel of judges, 
with the top applicants receiving funding. 
Funding 
• Access to finance remains a key challenge for many 
businesses across their early growth stages, and the 
business angel and venture capital market in Europe, 
and more so in Malta, is underdeveloped compared with 
leading global markets.
12 The Government will therefore look to establish an 
investment fund to provide equity-based risk capital to 
Maltese start-ups and scale-ups. It is envisaged that:
 · All investments will be structured through co-
investments19 with private investors who will 
participate alongside the Government on equal 
terms and conditions
 · Co-investments will only be undertaken with qualified 
business angels, venture capitalists, venture funds 
and private equity houses that have gone through 
an extensive screening and due diligence process to 
gain accreditation for the scheme
 · The involvement of the private sector as co-investors 
will create a multiplier effect in terms of the volume 
of funding available, and also help to increase deal 
flow and decrease investment risk and transaction 
costs. 
13 The Government will also look to update the rules of the 
Seed Investment Scheme, which provides tax credits to 
investors in return for investment in a qualifying Maltese 
start-up or early stage company. The changes being 
considered include:
 · The removal of certain restrictions relating to the 
type of qualifying activities
 · Wider company characteristics parameters to make 
the scheme accessible to later stage start-ups and 
scale-ups 
 · New investor eligibility criteria to make it possible 
for companies and collective investment schemes 
to avail of similar tax benefits  
19 Note: Co-investment is defined as any form of public equity investment (up to 
50%) in private companies alongside a partner organisation of qualified investors 
(such as VC funds or business angel networks),
excluding direct public investment in VC funds and funds of fund. (European 
Commission, 2017).
Malta: The Ultimate AI Launchpad
23
A Strategy and Vision for Artificial Intelligence in Malta 2030 
14 Malta Enterprise has launched various incentives schemes 
which can finance innovative AI undertakings with a viable 
business concept in their early stages of development. The 
incentive schemes will run through 2019 and 2020 and may 
be extended to the following years. Assistance includes: 
 · Seed funding grants of up to €25,000 under Business 
START (B.Start). The total budget available for this 
scheme is currently €1m per year. 
 · Repayable advances structured as a mezzanine 
finance instrument to support start-ups with a 
proven business concept undertake initiatives linked 
to raising equity investment from third parties, 
procuring equipment and crowd-funding. Typical 
support is in the range of €200,000 and advances are 
repayable over a number of years.
Capital gains tax relief on exits
15 The Government will consider introducing a change to 
Malta’s tax legislation to reduce/eliminate capital gains and 
duty on document on the transfer of shares. The proposed 
changes are expected to incentivise more entrepreneurs 
to start businesses, reward them for their successes and 
stimulate re-investment into other business ventures, thus 
driving further economic activity and employment.
Attract international talent, entrepreneurs 
and investors to Malta 
• Malta wishes to position itself as a leading hub for global 
start-up activity. The country already has a sizeable 
number of foreign entrepreneurs, companies and workers 
in digital and knowledge-based industries, mostly from the 
EU countries of Sweden, the UK, Germany, Italy, France 
and Spain. Malta will now implement further measures to:
 · Make it easier for non-EEA nationals looking to set 
up or invest in business locally
 · Incentivise workers with specialised skills that are 
in high demand both locally and globally to move to 
Malta
16 Malta will launch a “Start-up visa” for aspiring entrepreneurs 
who intend to develop an innovative business in Malta. 
Applications will be assessed on the strength of the 
business plan submitted, without any capital investment 
requirements. The visa will provide a simplified, fast-track 
procedure for start-up founders and their families from 
outside of the EU and the European Free Trade Area to 
reside and work in Malta, subject to the satisfaction of 
appropriate background checks on the applicants. A 
mechanism provides for temporary, then permanent, 
residence permits to be obtained subject to the fulfilment 
of certain requirements. 
• Malta’s Key Employee Initiative provides third-country 
nationals who will be employed in a managerial or highly 
technical post at a salary above €30,000 per annum with 
a fast-tracked, single permit for work and residence to 
be processed within five working days. The scheme is 
available to individuals working in the field of AI who meet 
these criteria. 
17 The Government will shortly re-introduce the Qualifying 
Employment in Innovation and Creativity (Personal Tax) 
Scheme. This incentive provides qualifying employees who 
work in wide range of AI-related roles, including industrial 
research and experimental development, product 
development and product and process innovation, and 
earn over €52,000 per annum to benefit from a reduced 
flat rate of personal income tax at 15% for a three-year 
period.

PUBLIC SECTOR ADOPTION
CHAPTER 3
Malta: The Ultimate AI Launchpad
25
A Strategy and Vision for Artificial Intelligence in Malta 2030 
Public sector adoption
AI can play a transformation role in the way public services are 
delivered, national resources are used and infrastructure is 
deployed. It also has the potential to make government more 
efficient, thus improving internal operations and governance, 
and leading to better use of taxpayers’ money. 
In June 2019, the Maltese Government launched Mapping 
Tomorrow20 , a strategic plan for the digital transformation of 
the public administration. In his foreword, Mr. Mario Cutajar, 
the Principal Permanent Secretary, states: “We cannot just 
address the present situation; we need to have foresight to 
look ahead beyond the present and into tomorrow… We are 
looking at how best to embed artificial intelligence capability 
into business processes and how to adopt other emerging 
technologies to achieve services of excellence… Our aim is 
to have a Digital Public Administration that is continuously 
renewing itself, transforming the way citizens and business 
interact with government and providing public services of 
excellence.”
AI can improve almost everything a government does and 
provide new choices in the way services are delivered. Various 
AI technologies have already reached a level where they can 
deliver significant tangible benefits today, with those that it 
could deliver in the next few years potentially being much larger. 
The Government aims to stimulate and catalyse AI adoption in 
Malta and will implement a series of actions across the next 
three years to turn this vision into a reality, including:
• Creating an AI-powered Government
• Implementing high-profile pilot projects to:
 · Provide better services to citizens/businesses
 · Improve the economic and social well-being of 
citizens/businesses
 · Improve the internal operations of the public 
administration
• Implementing policy actions to encourage procurement of 
smart technology-based solutions
Create an AI-powered Government 
18 The Government will look to explore how AI can be 
deployed across each area of government and public 
administration. The responsibility for carrying out these 
actions shall lay with the respective Ministries’ or state-
owned entities Chief Information Officers (CIOs).
 
19 An awareness campaign will be launched for public officers 
to build capacity, knowledge and understanding of what 
AI is, why it is important, and the benefits of public sector 
adoption. The awareness campaign will consist of:
 · An internal communications campaign, targeted to 
all public sector officials, to commence following the 
launch of the National AI Strategy
 · A series of awareness events between 2020 and 
2021 to equip public officials with foundational 
AI knowledge and insights into projects being 
undertaken by the Maltese Government 
 · Events for all senior officials in the public sector to 
build deep insight into the Government’s AI strategy 
and implementation plan, public sector AI projects, 
and local and global developments 
20 The public service training curricula will be updated in 
2020 to include AI-related courses. AI training courses will 
commence in 2021. Furthermore, financial support will be 
made available to public officers wishing to obtain external 
certification and qualification in AI-related areas. 
21 The public administration will accelerate the use of 
AI technologies across citizen services and internal 
administration through:
 · The development of a guidance document to 
highlight AI use case applications within the public 
administration and a checklist to reference when 
developing project proposals
 · The drafting of technical policy statements to assist 
in the adoption of AI for government services 
 · The formulation of a Technical Committee to review 
architecture of solutions to be implemented within 
Public Administration, particularly with regards to 
the adoption of AI
22 In 2017, Oxford Insights created the world’s first 
Government AI Readiness Index to answer the question: 
how well placed are national governments to take 
advantage of the benefits of AI in their operations and 
delivery of public services? The 2019 Government AI 
Readiness Index, produced with the support of the 
International Development Research Centre (IDRC), sees 
a development of this methodology and an expansion of 
scope to cover all UN countries (from our previous group 
of OECD members). It scores the governments of 194 
countries and territories according to their preparedness 
to use AI in the delivery of public service. Malta was ranked 
43rd in the 2019 Government AI Readiness Index. As 
part of the Strategy, the Government will monitor Malta’s 
performance in the AI Readiness Index and commission 
work to identify and implement measures to improve 
Malta’s standing.

Malta: The Ultimate AI Launchpad A Strategy and Vision for Artificial Intelligence in Malta 2030 
Encourage the procurement of smart 
technologies
23 The Government will also develop various policy measures 
that support the public procurement of emerging 
technologies solutions, including:
 · The launch of a new business case template which 
requires business owners to put forward a request 
for technology procurement to document whether 
emerging technologies have been considered – and 
if not, why. Business cases that align to national 
digital strategies, such as the Malta AI Strategy, will 
be prioritised. 
 · Enacting a training and awareness programme to 
build capacity and knowledge and to equip public 
administration procurement teams with insight 
into AI technologies, AI procurement frameworks 
such as the one currently being developed by the 
World Economic Forum21, and pre-commercial 
procurement methods. 
Implement high-profile AI pilot projects 
• The Malta.AI Taskforce and its Working Group for Public 
and Private Sector Adoption, in consultation with the 
Public Administration, have identified six AI pilot projects 
that will be undertaken and implemented by 2022 as part 
of the Strategy. 
• Each of these projects is expected to have a profound 
and positive impact across a large section of society and 
will play a key role in raising the visibility of the tangible 
benefits that AI can deliver to society and business. Each of 
the projects will also demonstrate Malta’s commitment to 
using AI to tackle the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs). 
• The MDIA will monitor that each pilot project gets 
implemented by the respective business owner. 
• A detailed assessment will be carried out following the 
conclusion of each of the pilot projects to determine the 
viability of a wider roll-out of each project at scale.

Malta’s pilot projects - AI for traffic management
“ A mobility analytics dashboard 
will be developed to generate 
location intelligence across different 
modes of transport in real time and 
leverage big data derived from Malta 
Public Transport (MPT) data and 
other sources.”
Business owner: Transport Malta
Ministry for Transport, Infrastructure and Capital 
Projects
24 Self-driving vehicles are regarded as a shining example 
of how much AI can transform the way we live. 
However, it could be at least two to three decades 
before we see a widespread roll-out on Maltese roads. 
Of more immediate use is the way AI can be used by 
traffic planners and controllers to reduce congestion, 
route traffic and improve road safety. 
Pilot projects to use AI to optimise traffic light control 
and waiting time flows have already been undertaken in 
various international locations, including the US, the UK, 
Germany and Singapore. A company running a project on 
50 intersections in Pittsburgh, US, claims to have reduced 
waiting times by up to 40%, journey times by 25% and 
vehicle emissions by up to 20%. In Hagen, Germany, 
AI-optimised traffic light control deployments suggest 
intersection waiting times can decrease by about a half 
compared with a traditional pre-timed signal plan.
Algorithms can power journey planner applications to 
suggest the best routes, methods of transport and the 
expected time needed to reach destinations. More data 
enables these applications to provide more accurate 
suggestions and predictions. 
This project will explore how AI can be incorporated into 
Malta’s traffic control systems and geographic information 
systems (GISs) to:
• Reduce congestion and emissions 
• Identify patterns in transport behaviours
• Deliver insights to enable intelligent journey planning 
and scheduling of public transport 
• Create intelligent private journey routing (in 
conjunction with third-party applications)
• Assist with monitoring, policing and enforcement
A mobility analytics dashboard will be developed to 
generate location intelligence across different modes of 
transport in real time and leverage big data derived from 
Malta Public Transport (MPT) data and other sources. 
The proposed project will consist of three parts that will be 
undertaken across a three-year period:
• Part 1: A pilot project to deploy an AI engine to manage 
traffic flow on one key junction. The solution will use 
existing video feeds to detect the number of vehicles 
on the road, then the AI software will process this 
information and control the traffic lights to keep traffic 
flow moving in the most optimal way, with a manual 
controller retaining oversight for safety purposes. 
• Part 2: The enhancement of Malta’s GIS system by 
connecting new data feeds to the current system and 
making the information available to third-party, AI-
enabled, journey planner and mapping applications. 
This will improve the accuracy of journey planning and 
provide real-time tracking of public transport through 
the development of a mobility analytics dashboard.
• Part 3: A detailed study on the potential for widespread 
AI enhancements to be incorporated in Malta’s traffic 
management system.

Malta’s pilot projects - AI in education
Business owner: Department of Learning 
and Assessment Programmes
Ministry for Education and Employment 
25 AI promises to enhance education at all levels, 
especially by providing personalisation at scale. The 
Ministry for Education and Employment (MEDE) 
has a wide-reaching vision for how AI can support 
its priorities and continuous improvement. The 
vision draws from the Framework for the Education 
Strategy for Malta 2014-2024, which focuses on the 
learner’s educational journey. Given the sensitivities of 
trialling new technologies in a sector as important as 
education, priority will be given to student and parent 
engagement throughout this initiative.
The main objectives of this strategy are to:
• Reduce the gaps in educational outcomes between 
boys and girls and between students attending 
different schools; decrease the number of low 
achievers and raise the bar in literacy, numeracy, and 
science and technology competence; and increase 
student achievement
• Support educational achievement of children at 
risk of poverty and from low socio-economic status 
and reduce the relatively high incidence of early 
school-leavers
• Increase participation in lifelong learning and adult 
learning
• Raise levels of student retainment and attainment in 
further, vocational and tertiary education and training
Looking ahead, it is foreseen that the introduction and 
implementation of AI will assist administrators and 
educators to provide individual and adaptive learning 
experiences to students and predict analytical trends to 
make informed decisions and issue relevant policies to 
achieve the targets set within the education strategy.
The proposed project will consist of two parts that will be 
undertaken by 2022:
• Part 1: A pilot project to develop an AI-powered 
adaptive learning system to help students achieve 
better education outcomes through personalised 
learning programmes based on student performance, 
ambitions and needs. The pilot will also help teachers 
to build more formative assessments of the pupils’ 
capabilities. The project will be piloted with 50 
educators and 1,000 students across primary and 
secondary education.
• Part 2: A pilot project to construct a rich data set 
and use AI to assist in driving insights and actions to 
enhance the education system. The initial project 
will focus on delivering predictive insights to assist in 
identifying early school-leavers to help educators take 
preventative actions to drive better outcomes.
The MEDE will ensure student and parent participation in the 
development, testing and deployment process, ascertaining 
that these important stakeholders in this initiative fully 
appreciate its benefits and the experimental nature of the 
pilot project, and have a meaningful route by which to make 
their concerns known.

Malta’s pilot projects - AI in healthcare
“The data-heavy nature of 
healthcare makes it one of 
the most exciting frontiers 
in AI. Malta has made 
significant investments to 
become a leader in the 
digital health space”
Business owner: Pharmacy of Your 
Choice (POYC) 
Ministry for Health
26 The increased availability of data and recent 
advancements in AI could present unprecedented 
opportunities in healthcare which create value for 
citizens, providers and regulators. As AI and deep 
learning enter the mainstream of clinical medicine, 
these technologies have the potential to complement 
and support healthcare professionals in enhancing the 
quality, efficiency and performance of healthcare, and 
break new frontiers in biomedical research.
Through AI technologies, healthcare professionals may 
be able to make better, quicker and more accurate 
decisions across diagnosis, treatment and care to improve 
patient health outcomes and increase the efficiency and 
sustainability of healthcare systems. 
Malta’s vision foresees AI being deployed in the future to: 
• Prevent disease within its population
• Optimise the care trajectory for patients with common 
chronic conditions
• Develop and apply precision therapies for complex 
illnesses
• Reduce adverse events
• Accelerate biomedical research
The data-heavy nature of healthcare makes it one of the 
most exciting frontiers in AI. Malta has made significant 
investments to become a leader in the digital health space 
and one of the best countries to undertake health-related 
AI pilot projects. 
The Pharmacy of Your Choice (POYC) repository captures 
entitlement, prescription and dispensing data for over 
143,000 active patients with chronic conditions. It has been 
maintained over a period of 10 years and now includes a 
wealth of information on the local population, including 
deceased persons, the prevalence of and shifts in chronic 
conditions, and the treatments provided in this regard. 
This is in addition to full demographic data, as well as 
data on related prescribing and dispensing practices and 
practitioners.  
The pilot project to be undertaken will explore how the 
application of AI on top of the POYC platform can:
• Assist prescribers to make more informed decisions 
from a patient safety perspective 
• Perform predictive analysis to drive cost savings in 
procurement spend
• Devise preventive care models at both the macro and 
micro level to create better health outcomes
The use of data to deliver more effective and less costly 
healthcare is central to the Malta’s Digital Health Strategy. 
The Ministry for Health is currently laying the technical, 
semantic and legal foundations for public health data to 
be collected, stored and made available for consumption 
in a standardised, structured and secure manner through 
the implementation of a National Electronic Health Record 
(NEHR) system. The NEHR project is underway and expected 
to go live by the end of 2021. It aims to generate better-
informed decisions by health professionals and ascertain 
continuity of care for patients. 
NEHRs are expected to create the perfect environment for 
curated, context-rich data, on which AI can be deployed 
to process large amounts of complex, interrelated health 
information in the most efficient and effective manner possible. 
This will be ever more important when large genomic data sets 
become mainstream and/or if indirectly linked data sets, such 
as those pertaining to the social determinants of health, are fed 
into machine learning models.
The Ministry for Health is committed to building trust in these 
new systems by keeping patient welfare and safety at the 
forefront, while working to ensure data privacy, transparency 
of algorithms, data standardisation and interoperability across 
multiple platforms.

Malta’s pilot projects - AI for customer service
“ Processing clients’ requests 
quickly, efficiently and as 
accurately as possible is of 
paramount importance. ”
Business owner: servizz.gov
Office of the Prime Minister
27 Many public and private sector organisations across 
the globe are using intelligent chatbots and similar AI-
driven solutions in call centers and customer service 
functions to augment and enhance their human-led 
services. 
The servizz.gov platform is the central point of information 
for all government services. Citizens and people living in 
Malta make use of servizz.gov through various channels, 
including email and telephone. When receiving any form 
of query regarding government services, assigned agents 
refer to the service catalogue and other online resources to 
gather information to draft an answer. 
Processing clients’ requests quickly, efficiently and as accurately 
as possible is of paramount importance. The project will 
explore how applying AI into the servizz.gov customer service 
workflow can drive perfomance enhancements across each of 
these areas. 
The project will consist of the phases below, with the first to be 
completed by 2022:
• The first phase will focus on the back office. An AI-driven 
email assistant will be created to assist servizz.gov agents, 
analyse citizens’ email queries automatically and provide 
the assigned agent with a suggested reply automatically. 
The agent will then use the suggested reply as a basis for 
the official final reply to the citizen, to minimise the time 
taken to reply to queries. A human agent will check and 
control the quality and content of the reply email, and 
the changes will be monitored by the AI system so that it 
continues to learn how to better formulate reply emails. 
However, the final say is that of the human agent.
• Later phases of the project envisage the development 
of a chatbot, which will use AI to initially determine how 
citizens can best be directed to obtain the information that 
they are seeking. The long-term strategy is to include voice 
assistance over the telephone, with the same principle 
of an AI system that is able to communicate and help 
customers with their queries, but in this case using the 
voice medium. 
All these services will be developed in both English and Maltese 
so that servizz.gov can serve clients in their preferred language. 
Furthermore, as an additional long-term strategy, it is envisaged 
that servizz.gov will be able to use machine translation services 
to communicate clearly with foreign nationals living in Malta in 
their preferred language.

Malta’s pilot projects - AI in tourism
Business owner: Malta Tourism Authority 
Ministry for Tourism
28 The Ministry for Tourism, with the Malta Tourism 
Authority (MTA), has commissioned the development 
of the Digital Tourism Platform, which will launch in 
2019. It aims to enable Malta to deliver better tourism 
experiences through technology by obtaining and 
leveraging valuable insights from data. The project 
will see the launch of interactive information kiosks 
in the main tourism areas and the creation of digital 
applications to provide tourists with the information 
they need. 
As a next step, AI will be incorporated into the Digital 
Tourism Platform to enable the development of rich tourist 
personas, which combine psychological characteristics, such 
as interests and lifestyle choices, with demographic data. 
Machine learning will enable the platform to create deeper 
and smarter personas as it collects more data. From this 
information, the Digital Tourism Platform will be able to:
• Suggest itineraries and experiences for tourists 
matched to their interests, similar to recommendation 
engines commonly used by digital music and television 
streaming services and social media
• Create propensity models based on predictive analytics 
to forecast where a tourist will go and which tickets they 
may purchase, and use that information to recommend 
suggestions, via targeted promotional notifications 
within the app, to balance loads and minimise queues. 
Subsequent phases of the project could see wider data 
sets, such as those from IoT sensors on bus stops and 
tourist attractions, incorporated into the platform to 
drive smarter, just-in-time recommendations. 
Building on this initiative, the Government plans to launch an 
Environment Passport initiative. The Environment Passport 
will provide VisitMalta+ app users with information and 
advice to make their visit more environmentally friendly 
and offer them rewards, such as discounted attraction 
admission fees, for undertaking environmentally friendly 
actions.
Other measures to incorporate technology into Malta’s tourism 
offering are also underway. These include the development of 
virtual experiences in museums and sites, using augmented 
reality (AR) to enrich the visitor’s experience and knowledge 
of the attraction and create a more immersive dimension. The 
project will also enable the MTA to set up a roaming virtual 
reality (VR) experience which will be used in overseas fairs when 
marketing the Maltese islands.

Malta’s pilot projects - AI for better utilities
Business owner: Information 
Management Unit
Ministry for Energy and Water Management
29 The utilities sector, especially the energy sector, is 
expected to undergo a profound transition over 
the coming decade. Renewable energy generation 
is expected to increase significantly, driven by 
technological enhancements and a drive at national, 
European and global levels for more green energy. 
Demand is also expected to increase, along with the 
number of electric vehicles on the road, with more 
viable battery technology and greater roll-out of electric 
vehicle charging points. These shifts will require new 
capacity from the grid and improvements in the system 
resilience of Malta’s energy supply. 
The utilities sector can benefit significantly from the 
introduction of AI – it can be used to automate manual 
processes, enable the interpretation of collected data, 
facilitate load distribution optimisation in accordance with 
live demand and supply, and enhance maintenance and 
performance. 
Malta’s national utility companies, Enemalta, Water Services 
Corporation and ARMS, are collecting huge amounts of raw 
data in both structured and unstructured form. The sheer 
scale of the available data and its rapid rate of change make 
it difficult to process using traditional database and software 
techniques. Machine learning algorithms running on local 
or cloud-based high-performance computing systems can 
provide the capabilities needed to improve operations and 
make faster, more intelligent decisions. 
A pilot project will be undertaken where: 
• AI algorithms will be used to collect, organise and 
analyse current data to discover patterns and other 
useful information relating to water and energy usage. 
The solution will deploy large-scale analytics and 
machine learning on customer data to help the utility 
companies to maximise resources and subsequently 
provide responsive real-time customer service 
management. Concurrently, they have the ability 
to make real-time adjustments to attain optimised 
generation efficiency.
 
• Predictive maintenance models and scenarios will 
also be developed. Data from various sources, 
such as historical maintenance records and sensor 
data from the network, will be used to facilitate the 
implementation of solutions which identify problems 
before they occur, reducing the need for the current 
time-intensive manual inspections.
The project is expected to drive better efficiency, resilience 
and stability across Malta’s energy and water networks, and 
lay the foundation for the next evolution of its smart grid 
network.

Build awareness of what AI is and how it can 
be deployed
• The Malta.AI Taskforce’s Working Group for Public and 
Private Sector conducted a survey22 amongst private 
enterprises in Malta to gauge awareness of what AI is, 
their interaction with AI technology, comfort with AI, 
plans and challenges related to AI deployment, and the 
areas in business where they would feel comfortable with 
AI being used.
• The research highlights the need to build awareness of 
what AI is and how it can be deployed, especially amongst 
SMEs. The key findings showed that:
 · Roughly half of respondents at companies surveyed 
did not have the correct understanding of what AI is
 · Only 50% were aware that they had ever interacted 
with an AI device; however, when made aware of 
some common AI applications, over 95% indicated 
that they had used one of these services over the 
last year
 · One-in-five business already uses AI technology, 
while a further quarter would do so in the coming 
years
 · Professionals not having the appropriate knowledge 
and skills, or with uncertainty about how to apply 
them, were stated by businesses as the biggest 
challenge to deploying AI solutions across their 
organisations
30 Various awareness activities will be undertaken which aim 
to build knowledge and encourage dialogue with private 
businesses. The activities will include:
 · A national AI publicity campaign to build AI awareness 
and knowledge, dispel myths and misconceptions, 
and generate awareness of stimuli (funding schemes 
and fiscal incentives) to support AI adoption
22 Note: The survey was conducted between June and July 2019 across a sample of 
private businesses that is representative of business size classification and sector of 
private businesses operating across the Maltese economy.
 · A series of public workshops to facilitate two-way 
dialogue between AI experts and industry
 · The development of sector-focused materials which 
aim to highlight how AI can be used across different 
business activities in the related industries
 · In consultation with the Malta Council for Social and 
Economic Development (MCESD), government will 
encourage trade unions, industry representatives 
and employers’ associations to run sector-focused 
seminars to explore how SMEs can utilise and 
benefit from AI tools
 · A public workshop, organised by the UoM, which will 
explore how private companies can collaborate with 
academia to develop AI solutions
Identify readiness of the private sector to 
adopt AI
31 Companies need a baseline level of digital maturity in order 
to adopt AI at scale. To help local companies understand 
and close gaps in their organisation and technology 
infrastructure that impede AI adoption, the Government 
will commission the development of an AI readiness 
toolkit, which will be used to help businesses understand 
where they are on their AI journey and provide practical 
advice to help them progress. The toolkit will contain:
 · An AI maturity and readiness assessment tool
 · Information on various AI technologies
 · Information on how AI can be applied to different 
areas of business and sectors (use cases)
 · Guidance to accelerate AI adoption
32 The Government will also develop and launch a Private 
Sector AI Readiness Index and publish the findings on an 
annual basis.
Private sector adoption
Private sector technology giants have swiftly brought AI into daily 
life through the applications they have developed. Algorithms 
used across search, social media, digital advertising and 
e-commerce recommendation engines are some of the most 
widespread examples. Whilst these applications are broadly 
used by businesses across the globe, there is an opportunity 
for private sector enterprises to do so much more with AI. 
The Government is looking to take an active role in stimulating 
broader AI adoption across the local private sector. It aims to set 
out a clear AI vision, direction and strategic priorities to guide 
private sector interest. Furthermore, it aims to help shape and 
accelerate private sector AI adoption through several measures 
listed below.
 
Malta: The Ultimate AI Launchpad
35
A Strategy and Vision for Artificial Intelligence in Malta 2030 
Help local businesses to incorporate AI into 
their business
• The Government will focus on designing measures that 
enable companies of all sizes to use, develop and integrate 
AI applications in the way they work and the way they do 
business. These include:
33 The development of support measures to help entities to 
carry out in-depth AI readiness assessments, an upgrade 
to industry 4.0, a review of business processes, and 
implementation of AI-based solutions
• Investment in the development of Maltese language 
tools to support AI-driven understanding and 
generation of Maltese text and speech to catalyse 
the deployment of AI solutions by industry (further 
information on this measure is provided on p.48) 
• The creation of Digital Innovation Hub for 
businesses to access technological expertise, 
advice and insight into industry practices (further 
information on this measure is provided on p.50) 
• Training programmes and financial support measures to 
help business owners and employees to develop AI-related 
skill sets (further information on this measure is provided 
on p.39)
Build trust in how AI works in terms of 
transparency and accountability
• The willingness and openness of private sector clients and 
consumers to use AI solutions in the way they are serviced 
will have a big role in dictating the pace of adoption. Malta 
has recently developed an Ethical AI Framework, Towards 
Trustworthy AI, which sets out Ethical AI Principles, 
Trustworthy AI Requirements and Control Practices for 
AI development and use which are ethically aligned, 
transparent and socially responsible (further information 
on this measure is provided on p.45).

EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE
CHAPTER 6
Malta: The Ultimate AI Launchpad
37
A Strategy and Vision for Artificial Intelligence in Malta 2030 
Education and workforce
Malta is predominantly a service-based economy that relies 
on quality human capital delivering high-value-added services. 
The Government recognises the critical function provided by 
the working population, as well as the education system in 
Malta, which provides the fundamental function of sustaining 
current and future generations of trained and educated people. 
At the same time, the onset and widespread adoption of AI is 
expected to disrupt current work practices and functions at a 
broader level and create both opportunities and skills gaps. 
The education system and workforce implications are therefore 
deeply intertwined elements of Malta’s AI Strategy.
As highlighted in the introductory section of this document, 
various studies have been undertaken by academics, 
research institutes and government bodies on the potential 
impact that automation will have on the workforce, but 
there appears to be little consensus on both the number 
of jobs at high risk from automation and the number of 
new jobs that are expected to be created by the technology. 
However, a few common themes are prevalent:
 · AI will drive big changes across all economic sectors: 
“New jobs will be created, others will disappear, 
most will be transformed23”
 · The pace of change will play out differently across 
countries, sectors and roles 
 · The workforce will need to acquire new skills and 
adapt their ways of working as AI becomes more 
widespread
Equip the workforce with stronger digital 
competencies and new skills
35 The Government will also design and launch a national 
reskilling programme to help vulnerable workers to 
develop new digital skills through the provision of 
short training courses and support measures for on-
the-job training. The programme will consider ways 
to involve the refugee community in such initiatives. 
36 Further support measures will be developed to help 
employers to invest more in on-the-job training and 
employees to undertake external training programmes. 
37 The Investing in Skills programme, co-financed through the 
European Social Fund (ESF), will be operational until 30 June 
2023 and has a budget of €5m to help employed people 
develop and increase knowledge and skills through training. 
38 The eSkills Malta Foundation, in collaboration with MDIA, 
will seek to offer professional certification courses in AI to 
various target groups.
Build awareness amongst the general 
population of what AI is and why it is 
important
39 Although AI is expected to bring numerous opportunities 
and improvements to our quality of life, it is acknowledged 
that this could be a big change. Another fundamental 
view is that this change cannot be avoided; instead, it is 
something that needs to be embraced and leveraged 
within our society and institutions.
Understand and plan for the impact of 
technology and automation on the Maltese 
labour market
34 A dedicated think tank will be set up to develop policy 
actions related to the impact of technology and automation 
on the Maltese workforce. The think tank will:
 · Conduct research to identify the more vulnerable 
skills and jobs in society
 · Propose and publish actionable insights to help 
the Government, businesses, unions and employer 
associations to develop robust transition plans
 · Engage in dialogue and perform consistent 
monitoring to develop in-depth insights into how 
these jobs are likely to be impacted
 · Establish defined training paths to help workers 
build new skills which better match the needs of 
businesses
 · Assess whether employment reforms and safeguards 
may need to be introduced to offset potential major 
upheavals in the job market which may be caused 
by automation
 · Develop incentive proposals to drive employers’ 
investment in upskilling
• All key stakeholders, including trade unions and employer 
associations, will be asked to participate in the think tank. 
The project will be coordinated by the National Skills 
Council and the eSkills Malta Foundation, which includes 
various representatives from government, industry and 
education. The two bodies are currently working on 
projects to evaluate skills and policy measures to address 
current and future skills gaps and upskill industries sectors 
in digital and emerging technologies, and the think tank 
will align with these activities.

• The Malta.AI Taskforce also conducted a survey24 amongst 
a representative cross-section of the Maltese population 
to measure awareness and attitudes towards AI. The 
research highlighted that:
 · More than 60% of respondents did not have the 
correct understanding of what  AI is
 · Only 42% were aware that they had ever interacted 
with an AI device. However, when made aware of 
some common AI applications, 80% indicated that 
they had used one of these services over the last 
year
 · Survey respondents’ comfort with AI usage varies 
by area of application, with just over 80% being 
comfortable with AI in transportation, and only 
about half being comfortable with AI in financial 
advice and justice
 · 70% expect AI to be beneficial to society, while 8 out 
of 10 respondents would be open to using more AI if 
it helped them in their daily lives
40 The Government will launch a national campaign to build 
awareness of what AI is, counteract fears and showcase 
how it will benefit Maltese citizens of all ages. The 
campaign will highlight how no parts of Maltese society 
will be unduly burdened or left behind as AI adoption 
accelerates. A key part of the campaign will aim to build 
trust in AI usage amongst the older generations who 
stand to benefit hugely from AI-enabled assistive home 
technologies, which can offer support with self-care and 
help offset anxiety, confusion and loneliness.
 
Build awareness of AI amongst students and 
parents
41 The MEDE, with the support of other stakeholders, will 
continue to organise the annual AI Family Challenge, a 
hands-on AI education programme that brings together 
families, schools, communities and technology mentors to 
give everyone the chance to learn, play and create using 
AI. They will also organise AI-themed weekends, game-
jams and AI hands-on workshops for children of all ages. 
42 The MEDE will also support and give funding to an annual 
AI Olympiad. The event is targeted at students in primary 
and secondary years and challenges them to learn 
and use AI methods to solve real-world problems. The 
winning team will be awarded the prize of attending and 
participating at the Global AI Congress event overseas. 
24 Note: The survey was conducted between June and July 2019 across a sample 
group of individuals that reflects the demographics of the Maltese population.
Foster and embrace the adoption of AI in 
education 
• One of the Malta AI Strategy’s key goals is to develop a 
modernised and boosted education system for Malta. 
While the education system and curricula have undergone 
a number of developments and innovations in recent 
years, the broader delivery of training and education has 
not developed significantly from the traditional classroom-
based setup.
• Advancements in AI in education have the potential to 
allow for a personalised learning system which draws 
on vast learner and student data, leading to a richer and 
better transfer of knowledge.
• The MEDE has a wide-reaching vision of how AI can 
support its priorities and continuous improvement. 
This includes the introduction and implementation 
of AI to help administrators and educators to provide 
individual and adaptive learning experiences, as 
well as predicting analytical trends to take informed 
decisions and develop relevant policies to achieve the 
targets set out in Malta’s education strategy.
• These changes will not happen overnight or in isolation 
from other activities: they will be introduced gradually over 
the coming 10 years in close collaboration with educators, 
teaching unions, parents, students and other related 
stakeholders.
• As part of the development of the National AI Strategy, 
the Malta.AI Taskforce Work Group for Education and 
Workforce met with a number of policy makers, educators 
and industry representatives to understand their position, 
levels of support and concerns relating to the introduction 
of AI in education. A workshop was held in conjunction 
with the largest teachers’ union in Malta, the Malta Union 
of Teachers (MUT), where their representatives put 
forward over 30 different ideas of how AI solutions could 
be incorporated into the education environment from 
student, teacher and system-facing perspectives.
• The MEDE will now take forward a number of pilot projects 
to support the introduction of AI in education. Further 
information on the proposed pilot projects is provided on 
page p.30.
43 The MEDE will also set up a working group involving 
schools and all of Malta’s teachers’ unions with the remit 
to co-develop the implementation of these projects, jointly 
assess outcomes and develop a strategy for a wider roll-
out of AI in education.

A Strategy and Vision for Artificial Intelligence in Malta 2030 
Develop teachers’ knowledge and awareness 
of AI in education
• The Strategy recognises and acknowledges that the 
functions of the human teacher cannot be replicated or 
automated, and that AI in education represents support for 
the teaching profession in the continuous development of 
people. Tools should assist teachers, not create additional 
burdens.
• Building support for the introduction of AI tools in education 
requires teachers to develop appropriate awareness, be 
kept informed on key developments, receive appropriate 
training and ensure that any implementation plans are 
properly structured.
44 The MEDE will organise an annual conference on AI in 
education to inform, support and disseminate good 
practices in AI for teaching, learning and assessment 
purposes. International experts from the teaching 
profession will participate and share key learnings relating 
to the use of AI in their educational establishments. 
45 The MEDE will develop and introduce introductory AI 
training at all levels, including education officers, school 
management, teachers and learning support assistants. 
46 The Government will also introduce a scheme to 
provide financial reimbursement for educators 
wishing to obtain certification in approved 
Massive Open Online Courses in AI-related fields. 
47 The UoM will look to introduce AI-related components as 
part of an update to its Masters in Teaching and Learning 
programme, which qualifies graduates to enter the 
teaching profession in Malta.
Equip all students enrolled in higher education 
programmes in Malta with AI skills
• AI is expected to change or transform work activities across 
every economic sector. It is therefore imperative to build AI 
knowledge and skills across all academic disciplines as the 
younger generation get ready to enter the working world.
48 Starting in the 2019/20 academic year, students 
undertaking any course at the UoM will be able to select 
AI elective modules as part of their studies. The modules 
will provide students with European Credit Transfer and 
Accumulation System credits (ECTS), which count towards 
their overall degree.
49 The Malta College of Arts, Science & Technology (MCAST), 
Malta’s technical college for applied studies, has committed 
to introducing obligatory AI components across all courses 
within the next three years.
50 The MEDE will also work to support private higher 
education institutions in developing and expanding current 
and future AI-related programmes and modules.
Increase the number of graduates and post-
graduates with AI-related degrees
• AI skills are in high demand and are crucial to a thriving 
AI ecosystem. LinkedIn recently published research on 
the most promising jobs of 201925: “These positions 
come with high salaries, a significant number of job 
openings and year-over-year growth, and are more 
likely to lead to a promotion.” Data scientists topped the 
list of promising jobs in the US, whilst machine learning 
engineers had the joint-highest median US salary. 
• The UoM’s AI department has its roots in the early 90s when 
the first AI research was being conducted. Today, it offers 
various short courses, a B.Sc.AI, an M.Sc. AI and a PhD degree 
which provides specialisations in different areas of AI. 
• Undergraduate student intake for the B.Sc.AI course 
increased by 300% across the 2018/19 academic year and 
is expected to increase once again during the 2019/20 
academic year.
51 The UoM will look to develop an Applied AI Platform (an 
interdisciplinary entity within the university aimed at 
fostering collaborations between different faculties and 
institutions) over the coming years. The investment will 
enable the UoM to increase the number of academics, areas 
of research and specialist modules it can offer; develop 
new joint degree undergraduate and post-graduate 
courses with other faculties; embark on new research and 
EU projects; increase its work with industry on AI-related 
projects; and accelerate AI awareness programmes. 
52 The country will strengthen its core knowledge base 
of specialists by providing around 50 scholarships per 
year between 2020 and 2022, for students to undertake 
post-graduate studies in AI (Masters/PhD level) at the 
UoM. These scholarships will supplement those already 
provided directly by the university. The Government will 
also continue to provide scholarships and financial support 
to carry out post-graduate studies in AI outside Malta 
under the Tertiary Education Scholarship Scheme (TESS). 
53 The Government recently introduced legislation to provide 
individuals who undertake Master (MQF Level 7) and PhD/
Doctoral (MQF Level 8) level qualifications with a tax credit 
for the full amount of income tax that would be due on the 
first €60,000 of earnings, subject to the satisfaction of certain 
criteria. The tax credit would be for a single year for individuals 
who obtain a Master’s degree, and for a period of two years 
for individuals who obtain a PhD/Doctoral qualification.

MCAST’s AI Strategy and Action Plan
54 To further increase the number of qualified AI specialists, 
the UoM will provide access to the Masters in AI programme 
to a wide cohort of applicants from different backgrounds. 
ICT professionals with strong industry experience but no 
undergraduate degree, and graduates with undergraduate 
degrees in different areas may be granted access to the 
course on either a full- or part-time basis, subject to 
completing three foundational modules prior to entry. This 
entry route is in place for the 2019/20 academic year and 
will remain thereafter.
 
It is envisaged that, in the coming years, the AI revolution will 
bring about a series of disruptions in both the job market and the 
education ecosystem. MCAST has therefore developed the 2020-
2025 AI Strategy and Action Plan, which aims to map out how: 
 · AI will be intrinsically embedded into MCAST’s daily 
operations
 · Students can be better prepared for an AI-powered 
industry
 · AI tools will be used to improve learning experiences, 
support teachers and facilitate administrative 
functions
 · Lecturers can gain more competence in 
understanding and applying AI in teaching, research 
and industry solutions
The MCAST AI Strategy and Action Plan will be enabled 
through nine strategic actions that will be undertaken over a 
five-year period. The initiatives include AI-enabled enhanced 
e-learning environments and intelligent tutoring systems, the 
development of AI-driven personalised learning applications, 
the introduction of AI as a core part of course curricula across 
all areas of study and the development of AI-specific courses, 
and professional development for academics in AI-related 
areas.
  
The MCAST AI Strategy and Action Plan is available for download 
at https://www.mcast.edu.mt/wp-content/uploads/AI-Strategy 
Final.pdf
55 MCAST will pilot the introduction of AI-specific components 
as part of post-graduate programmes in 2020 and will 
launch AI-specific post-graduate programmes by 2025. AI 
is already a key part of its IT-related programmes below 
post-graduate level.

Establish an Ethical AI Framework Towards 
Trustworthy AI
56 In August 2019, Malta published a draft Ethical AI 
Framework, Towards Trustworthy AI26, which aims to 
establish a set of guiding principles and trustworthy AI 
governance and control practices. The Government’s 
ambition is to create a practical and workable framework 
that can serve as a guide and enabler for AI practitioners to 
create trustworthy AI in Malta and beyond.
• The intention is for the Malta Ethical AI Framework to 
support AI practitioners in identifying and managing 
the potential risks of AI, while also serving to identify 
opportunities to encode a higher ethical standard into AI. 
The draft document was released for public consultation 
in August 2019 and the final version is expected in October 
2019, shortly after the release of the Strategy.
57 A National Technology Ethics Committee will also be set 
up under the MDIA to oversee the Ethical AI Framework 
and its intersection across various policy initiatives, 
including investments in tools and continuous monitoring 
mechanisms, skills and capabilities, innovation ecosystem 
and regulatory mechanisms.

and Innovation within the Office of the Prime Minister (2019). Malta towards 
Trustworthy AI, Malta Ethical Framework.
Legal and ethical
AI raises profound questions across ethical, legal and 
regulatory domains, from protecting national security 
and citizens’ rights to advancing commercial interests and 
international standing. As AI use cases proliferate, it is 
important that these issues are addressed at the outset to 
mitigate risks and unintended outcomes. Otherwise, Malta’s 
development into the “Ultimate AI Launchpad” may be 
hindered by a lack of trust and low adoption by stakeholders. 
For an AI system to be trusted, ethics, governance and strong 
control practices must be central to its design and deployment. 
Organisations which effectively incorporate ethical 
considerations into their AI projects, supported by a robust risk 
management system and monitoring mechanisms, can expect 
to gain a competitive advantage over their peers.
In order for Malta to develop a top 10 national AI programme, 
it will require an AI ecosystem that promotes acceleration in 
the achievement of the benefits of AI while minimising its risks.

A Strategy and Vision for Artificial Intelligence in Malta 2030 
Trustworthy AI Requirements
• Malta’s Ethical AI Framework builds on the European 
Commission’s AI HLEG Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI 
published on 8 April 2019 and the Recommendation of the 
Council on Artificial Intelligence adopted on 21 May 2019 by 
the OECD countries and various non-member adherents. 
• The Malta Ethical AI Framework sets out four Ethical AI 
Principles for establishing trustworthy AI which are in 
alignment with the European Commission’s AI HLEG Ethics 
Guidelines for Trustworthy AI:
• Human autonomy: humans interacting with AI systems 
must be able to keep full and effective self-determination 
over themselves
• Prevent harm: AI systems must not cause harm at any 
stage of their lifecycle to humans, the natural environment 
or other living beings
• Fairness: the development, deployment, use and 
operation of AI systems must be fair
• Explicability: end users and other members of the public 
should be able to understand and challenge the operation 
of AI systems as required for the particular use case.
A Communication from the European Commission titled 
Building Trust in Human Centric Artificial Intelligence27 outlines 
that “trust is a prerequisite to ensure a human-centric approach 
to AI: AI is not an end in itself, but a tool that has to serve people 
with the ultimate aim of increasing human well-being”.
• To achieve trustworthy AI, the Ethical AI Principles 
discussed above must be translated into specific 
requirements for AI systems that can be measured and 
evaluated. Reflecting on the EU’s work, the Malta Ethical 
AI Framework identifies seven specific requirements that 
AI systems should respect to be considered trustworthy. 
27 Source: Communication from the Commission (2019). Building Trust in Human 
Centric Artificial Intelligence (COM(2019) 168 final). European Commission.
Malta Ethical AI Framework
• The Trustworthy AI Requirements are interrelated 
and should be continuously evaluated and addressed 
throughout the AI system’s lifecycle. The relevance and 
level of importance of each of the requirements will 
depend on the nature of each use case, and will need to 
take into consideration the objectives, data sets, functional 
components, level of autonomy, environmental conditions 
and impacts of each particular AI system. It is also important 
to note that some of the above requirements are already 
reflected in existing laws. For example, Article 22 of the 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) establishes that 
when companies use AI to make a “significant decision” 
about individuals, the data subject has the right to have a 
human review that decision.
 
44
Malta: The Ultimate AI Launchpad A Strategy and Vision for Artificial Intelligence in Malta 2030 
• It is common for early technology developers to 
prioritise innovation and benefit realisation over 
controls. But with AI, as it develops its decision 
framework through adaptive learning rather than pre-
programmed code, it’s important that ethical, legal and 
regulatory requirements are considered as part of the 
training conditions for an AI system from the outset. 
• Due to the unique nature of AI and the quasi-cognitive nature 
of the activities it is performing, new control constructs will 
also be required to augment those historically used for 
legacy technology. The development of a robust system 
of controls for an AI system will require the retrofit of 
control practices over human-based processes to machine 
based-decisions, and the codification of ethical and trust 
objectives into system objectives and monitoring practices. 
• The Malta Ethical AI Framework, Towards Trustworthy AI, 
also includes a set of over 60 illustrative leading practice 
control practices for AI, first at the governance level and then 
for each of the Trustworthy AI Requirements, which have 
guidance to AI practitioners in developing a robust 
control framework for ethical and trustworthy AI. 
The Malta Ethical AI Framework will be updated 
as new guidance materials are released and as 
changes are identified through AI project pilots. 
• The draft Ethical AI Framework, Towards Trustworthy AI, is 
available for download at www.malta.ai. The final version 
will be released in October 2019 following an analysis of 
the feedback received during the public consultation.
Launch the world’s first national AI 
certification framework
• Malta has taken a global lead in developing a regulatory 
and certification framework for innovative technology 
arrangements through the setting up of the MDIA and 
the creation of the Innovative Technologies Arrangements 
and Services (ITAS) Act. The certification framework was 
intentionally developed to be technology neutral and 
voluntary because the country understood that individuals 
and organisations of good intent would seek out a positive 
sign of recognition that would build trust and transparency 
amongst users, consumers and wider stakeholders, even 
if not mandated by a national competent authority (NCA). 
58 Malta intends to continue its strong tradition as an innovator 
and first mover in the space of innovative technologies. 
It will therefore amend the ITAS Act to expand the list of 
technologies that the MDIA provides certification for and 
become the first country in the world to launch a national 
AI certification programme in October 2019.
• The certification process will largely be based on Malta’s 
Ethical AI Framework, which aligns and builds on the 
EU and OECD ethical frameworks, in order to provide 
applicants with valuable recognition in the marketplace 
that their AI systems have been developed in an ethically 
aligned, transparent and socially responsible manner. 
The ambition is to create the right frameworks to help 
trustworthy AI springboard from Malta to the world, in line 
with Malta’s vision to become the “Ultimate AI Launchpad”. 
• Certification will be issued by the MDIA, the national 
regulator with responsibility for governmental policies 
and regulation on emerging technologies, including 
the development and enforcement of standards for 
compliance with local and international obligations. 
• The MDIA’s AI certification process will include a detailed 
assessment process carried out by independent, 
MDIA-approved system auditors who will review 
the control frameworks in place in order to achieve 
ethical and trustworthy AI. The process also includes 
a business review, with due diligence on the key 
people behind and involved in the business, to build 
additional layers of trust from users of the technology. 
• The MDIA recognises that it is working at the forefront 
of technology regulation and the innovative technologies 
that it reviews. The main challenge is to ensure that the 
MDIA’s regulatory function does not hinder innovation 
in the field of AI. The MDIA would like to actively 
collaborate with European institutions and international 
organisations on AI-related initiatives to understand 
emerging standards and norms, and firmly supports 
global initiatives to develop standards to use AI for good. 
• Additional information about the Malta AI certification process 
is available at www.mdia.gov.mt and www.malta.ai.

Appoint a Technology Regulation Advisory 
Committee to advise on legal matters
• The regulation of AI is a hotly debated area. There are 
polarising views on the topic, with some commentators 
suggesting that AI regulation will stifle innovation and 
others firmly believing that it is the only way to ensure that AI 
technologies are used in an ethical and trustworthy manner. 
• The EU Parliament stated that28 “many policy aspects 
relevant for AI-enabled services, including rules on 
consumer protection and policy on ethics and liability, are 
covered by the existing regulatory framework on services”. 
It also said that it “considers that a comprehensive 
law or regulation on AI should be approached with 
caution as sectoral regulation may provide policies 
that are general enough but also refined up to the level 
where they are meaningful for the industrial sector”. 
• The Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI published by 
AI HLEG state: “AI systems do not operate in a lawless 
world. A number of legally binding rules at European, 
national and international level already apply or are 
relevant to the development, deployment and use of AI 
systems today. Legal sources include, but are not limited 
to: EU primary law (the Treaties of the European Union 
and its Charter of Fundamental Rights), EU secondary 
law (such as the General Data Protection Regulation, the 
Product Liability Directive, the Regulation on the Free 
Flow of Non-Personal Data, anti-discrimination directives, 
consumer law, and Safety and Health at Work Directives), 
the UN Human Rights treaties and the Council of Europe 
conventions (such as the European Convention on Human 
Rights), and numerous EU Member State laws. Besides 
horizontally applicable rules, various domain-specific 
rules exist that apply to particular AI applications (such as 
the Medical Device Regulation in the healthcare sector).” 
• The European Commission has also set up working groups 
to consider whether updates or the development of new 
legislation might be required to fully address the risks and 
challenges brought about by AI technologies.
59 The Maltese Government will appoint legal experts to form 
a Technology Regulation Advisory Committee to:
 · Assess and determine the extent to which existing 
laws and regulations will apply to AI technologies 
(matters relating to IP and liability-related issues will 
be a priority)
 · Analyse local laws and regulations that may need to 
change to keep pace with technology
 · Monitor and consider developments at a European 
level
 · Advise on the setting up of a Regulatory Sandbox for 
AI
28 Source: Motion for a European Parliament Resolution on a comprehensive 
European industrial policy on artificial intelligence and robotics ((2018/2088(INI)). 
European Parliament.
• Malta is currently working on a Private Law Bill 
that aims to provide clarity on specific provisions 
related to IP and liability issues in the context of DLT. 
• As a next phase, the country will explore whether further 
provisions could be developed which would clarify 
ownership of IP rights in AI-generated outputs, particularly 
where multiple entities are involved in the value chain. 
Liability-related issues on specific use cases, open source 
development and automated decision making will also be 
explored to help determine if supplementary legislation 
may be needed to mitigate some potential blockers and 
grey areas in existing legislation. Furthermore, the country 
will look into competition law and the antitrust aspects of 
AI with respect to control of data.
Set up a Regulatory Sandbox for AI and a Data 
Sandbox for AI
• Certain regulatory provisions may restrict the ability to test 
new AI applications and ideas.
60 The country will therefore look to set up a Regulatory 
Sandbox for AI which will provide regulatory exemptions 
to enable firms to explore and test concepts and solutions 
with proportionate safeguards, in a contained environment 
for a well-defined duration. Sandbox tests are expected 
to be modelled on particular use cases. The Technology 
Regulation Advisory Committee will therefore work with 
the MDIA to identify and determine the best legal and 
operational structure for the Regulatory Sandbox, given 
the diverse range of applications, sectors and regulations 
that AI can potentially touch.
• The European legislative framework on the protection 
of personal data (the GDPR) sets out clear and strict 
rules on how the processing of personal data must be 
carried out by controllers to ensure that the fundamental 
rights and freedoms of data subjects are safeguarded. 
61 In addition to the Regulatory Sandbox proposed above, the 
Office of the Information and Data Protection Commissioner 
(IDPC), as the national data protection authority, will also 
set up a Data Sandbox to support organisations that need 
to use personal data in the process of developing or testing 
innovative products and services in the specific area of AI. 
Data Sandbox participants will be guided and assisted 
by the IDPC on how to apply data protection rules and 
requirements to their projects and be given assurances, to 
the extent possible, that such projects do not infringe the 
provisions of the GDPR. The scope of the Data Sandbox is 
to give a certain level of comfort from enforcement action. 
Projects will be assessed on the degree of demonstrable 
benefit that they will potentially deliver to the public. 
• Both of these services would be closely monitored to 
enable the regulatory authorities to contain risk, and build 
capacity and experience in regulating these fields.

Ecosystem Infrastructure
The Government is aware that cutting-edge technology and data 
infrastructure, together with supportive regulatory and policy 
initiatives, are needed for the Malta AI Strategy  to truly take off. 
Investment in Maltese Language Resources
• In 2013, Rosner and Joachimsen assessed the state 
of the Maltese language in digital media, particularly 
the extent to which it is used and, more importantly, 
the extent to which such use is supported through the 
deployment of tools and resources. The conclusions 
reached from the results of this analysis are that the level 
of technological support for Maltese, compared with that 
for other European languages, is extremely low, giving 
rise to the threat of “digital extinction” for the language. 
In this context, “digital extinction” refers to the possibility 
that Maltese, while possibly maintaining its status as a 
national tongue with institutional support and recognition, 
is nevertheless virtually absent from digital media. 
• English has therefore become the default language choice 
across most technological devices in Malta, simply because 
there are more resources available and they are easier to 
use.
62 In order to counteract this, the country will make 
crucial investments in the development of Maltese 
language resources and tools. The investment will 
enable computers to be able to process, understand 
and generate Maltese text and speech, and AI solutions 
to be developed and accessible in both of Malta’s 
national languages and become a part of everyday life. 
• The Maltese language resources and tools will also have 
a ripple effect on many sectors, including education 
and health. It will be possible to create more advanced 
software to process data in Maltese in a more efficient 
and accurate manner and to create education tools for 
the Maltese language that make use of these underlying 
language technologies.
Incentivise further investment in data centres
• AI applications are likely to generate and require a 
tremendous amount of near real-time data, necessitating 
adequate data centre infrastructure on the island to 
support the high-quality connectivity and high-efficiency 
hosting services.
• Therefore, the sustained growth of the data centre services 
market in Malta, and the positive sentiment towards 
further market development opportunities, have given 
rise to continued investment in the industry. Additionally, 
to meet the growing computing and storage demands of 
public services, both the Government and the UoM have 
invested in building their own data centre facilities.
63 The Government is keen to stimulate further private 
investment into the sector. Malta Enterprise, the country’s 
economic development agency, will offer a number of 
support measures and incentives to encourage this, while 
competitive electricity tariffs are on offer to companies 
undertaking such business activities.
There are various dimensions of enabling infrastructure that 
need to be part of a holistic AI ecosystem, which are illustrated 
in the diagram below.

A Strategy and Vision for Artificial Intelligence in Malta 2030 
Establish a Digital Innovation Hub (DIH) with a 
focus on AI
• Institutional infrastructure will be required to drive AI 
adoption, and these organisations will be mandated to 
provide support to the intended end users. The European 
Commission’s Digital Europe Programme29 includes 
proposals for €9.7b in funding for supercomputing, AI, 
cybersecurity and trust, digital skills and DIHs (“one-stop 
shops” for SMEs and public administrations to access 
technological expertise, advise and experimentation 
facilities) which are being established as centres of 
excellence that provide insight into industry practices and 
research.
64 Malta plans to establish a DIH with a focus on AI. The hub 
will be a multi-stakeholder innovation centre that aims to 
help both the public and private sector to grasp new digital 
opportunities. The DIH will allow both public and private 
stakeholders to access sector-specific, technological and 
financial expertise, and streamline efforts to increase 
Malta’s AI-related research and innovation activities. The 
DIH aims to provide assistance in setting out how the 
application of AI can be used to solve real-life problems 
through applied research, demo spaces and advisory 
services.
Increase the extent of the open data 
availability to support AI use cases
• As part of the implementation of the Public-Sector 
Information Directive, the Malta Information Technology 
Agency (MITA) drafted its National Data Strategy30 in 
2016 with a holistic and comprehensive vision for 
the management of data across the whole public 
administration, set out as one of the pillars of the Digital 
Malta Strategy, and a vision for data to empower citizen 
and business applications. The National Data Strategy 
comprises a set of general principles and best practices 
that should guide future investments in this domain. 
65 Additionally, MITA has recently launched Malta Data Portal31, 
which included 41 registers and 200 data sets covering 10 
sectors by September 2018, and will increase as the initiative 
is further developed. It aims to provide a one-stop shop 
for the discovery, viewing, downloading and online usage 
of data which is classified and has all the requirements of 
the open data definition. As a next step, The National AI 
Strategy will consider measures to increase the number of 
public data sets available, while ensuring that the interests 
of Maltese companies and individuals are protected. 
66 As part of the National AI Strategy, a roadmap will also 
be prepared to identify ways of integrating information 
from sensor-based sources and other relevant data into

• INSPIRE, formally known as European Directive 2007/2/EC, 
establishes an infrastructure for spatial information in the 
EU. The Directive was transposed into Maltese legislation 
under the provisions of the Development Planning Act and 
brought into force by Legal Notice on 22 December 2009. 
Environmental-related geospatial data sets are available 
through the Malta Spatial Data Infrastructure (MSDI) 
portal. AI use cases will also require access to geo-spatial 
information, and the MSDI is an enabler to this.
Provide cost-effective access to compute 
capacity
• Access to large-scale compute capability is a foundational 
element of AI research and development. Malta will 
require access to local, regional and global infrastructure 
and will consider various policy measures to facilitate this. 
Emerging compute capabilities and technologies could 
potentially be explored to create a mix of specialised 
compute solutions, each targeted at different use cases, 
thereby improving the overall cost effectiveness. Many 
organisations throughout Europe have already invested 
heavily in the creation of significant compute capabilities.
• On a national level, supercomputing cluster A.L.B.E.R.T. 
at the UoM supports various research initiatives, 
including studies that are catered towards AI. Moreover, 
the Government of Malta Hybrid Cloud offers flexible 
architecture and access to a global, scalable infrastructure 
that can utilise cloud machine learning tools. 
• The European High-Performance Computing Joint 
Undertaking (EuroHPC JU) will pool European resources 
to develop top-of-the-range exascale supercomputers

technology. The EuroHPC JU is a legal and funding entity 
which will enable the pooling of EU and national resources 
in high-performance computing (HPC), with the aim of:
 · Developing a pan-European supercomputing 
infrastructure: buying and deploying two 
supercomputers in the EU that will be among the top 
five in the world and at least two others that would 
today rank in the global top 25 for Europe’s private 
and public users, and scientific and industrial users, 
for use in more than 800 scientific and industrial 
application fields
 · Supporting research and innovation activities: 
developing a European supercomputing ecosystem, 
stimulating a technology supply industry, and making 
supercomputing resources in many application 
areas available to a large number of public and 
private users, including SMEs32

• The total planned budget for EuroHPC JU from 2019 to 2026 
through the co-investment with Member States is around 
€1 billion, €486 million of which emanates from the actions 
already planned by the European Commission in Horizon 
2020 and Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) programmes in 
the current Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF).33The 
budget will be matched by a corresponding amount from 
participating countries, where industry has expressed 
an existing need for HPC access for research purposes. 
• Through the EU’s share in the EuroHPC JU, the Maltese 
Government can benefit from the EuroHPC initiative 
through the involvement of national stakeholders in 
the relevant European funded research. In the longer 
term, if industry demand for access to the EuroHPC 
research facilities justifies it, government can explore 
joining the EuroHPC funding to provide such access. 
67 The Maltese Government will look towards expanding 
access to high-performance compute capacity 
across on-demand, on-premise and European 
infrastructures as part of the National AI Strategy. 
68 A feasibility study will be conducted to assess the needs 
for HPC in Malta, taking into account interoperability, 
participation and dependencies with regard to EuroHPC. 
69 AI is exceedingly being offered through cloud platforms. 
The Government will therefore leverage the investment 
in the Government of Malta Hybrid Cloud to support 
demand for AI compute capacity and make use 
cases of a limited scale more feasible to undertake. 
70 The Government will also pilot a small-scale supercomputer 
cluster hosted locally to support public sector, private 
sector and research use cases for potential interconnection 
with EuroHPC. Investment could facilitate migration of 
demand from the Government of Malta Hybrid Cloud to 
a national super compute cluster in 2022 if economics for 
cloud are less favourable to a capital outlay in national HPC 
infrastructure.
Expand Malta’s data economy through 5G  
and IoT
• Malta has a leading telecommunications infrastructure and 
is at the top of the European Commission’s Digital Economy 
and Society Index (DESI) 2019 scoreboard for coverage of 
next-generation access (NGA) technologies and ultrafast 
broadband connectivity34. Fixed broadband speeds of up 
to 1Gbps are available on a nationwide basis, in addition 
to connectivity from 75,000 high-speed Wi-Fi hotspots. 
• Malta is connected to the global internet by five submarine 
fibre optic cables to Sicily (which is connected to mainland 
Italy), all delivering high-capacity international connectivity. 
The Maltese Government is also actively studying the

feasibility of a new submarine cable connecting Malta to 
other locations, with the goal of enhancing the resilience 
and quality of the current international electronic 
communications connectivity.
• All three local telecommunication companies have 
expressed their intention to continue investing in 
upgrading their mobile networks, while planning to 
capitalise on new technologies such as 5G and the IoT. 
• The Maltese telecoms regulator already operates a 
test-and-trial licensing scheme in support of innovative 
spectrum uses; it aims to exploit Malta’s unique 
potential as a test bed, both for technology tests and 
service trials involving third parties or the public. 
• An international telecommunications company recently 
signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) 
with the Government to promote and harness the 
latest disruptive technologies to boost innovation in 
Malta. Two pilot projects are currently underway, with 
the first using the IoT for a network of public smart 
recycling bins and the second focused on smart parking 
applications. The company announced that it will also 
be collaborating with the Malta on AI-related areas. 
• The Maltese Government will actively engage with local and 
international companies that are interested in using the 
country as a test bed for 5G and IoT trials, as it is believed 
that investment in these complementary technologies 
will boost the development of Malta’s AI ecosystem and 
stimulate the launch of new data economy services, 
products and applications across different economic 
sectors.
• An EU-financed Research on Smart Cities project is 
currently underway. The project aims to assess the latest 
advances in Europe in the development of smart cities and 
determine which are most applicable to Malta, along with 
how much they would cost to implement and sustain. The 
experiences that have been learnt through the adoption of 
these developments by other European Member States are 
also being analysed to proactively determine the potential 
outcomes of local smart city developments.
71 The Government is keen to ensure that investments 
undertaken in sensor and device infrastructure which can 
enable IoT applications are fully leveraged. It therefore 
plans to:
 · Develop a registry which provides information on all 
government sensor and IoT networks
 · Identify where DLTs can add enhancements, 
including decentralised authentication services and 
digital trust at scale
 · Develop and prototype applied DLTs within a sensor 
and IoT network, assess results and propose a 
strategy for wider roll-out

Identify best practices for securing national AI 
solutions
• Launching cybersecurity on a national scale essentially 
calls for a planned, collective and systematic approach. 
Accordingly, this led to the need for a National Cyber 
Security Strategy which brings together all the relevant 
players in the cybersecurity space. In line with European 
regulations, Malta maintains an established Critical 
Information Infrastructure Protection Directorate, which 
also operates the national Computer Security Incident 
Response Team.
• The Directorate also serves as the national authority 
overseeing Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning 
measures for a high common level of security for network 
and information systems across the EU. The oversight 
of the security of electronic communications networks 
and services is part of the regulatory remit of the Malta 
Communications Authority, whereas privacy and data 
protection aspects are overseen by the Information 
and Data Protection Commissioner. MITA overseas the 
cybersecurity of the Government’s infrastructure and 
establishes government policies in the cybersecurity space. 
Other relevant players include the entities entrusted with 
public security, such as the police and the army.
• A National Cyber Security Strategy was launched in 
September 2016 following public consultation. The 
document presented the strategic approach for 
cybersecurity on a national scale. It intended to build an 
awareness of cybersecurity, its extent and its implications 
for Malta as an integral part of cyberspace.
72 The intersection of AI and cybersecurity poses various 
technical, ethical and governance challenges. The 
Government will therefore undertake a risk assessment 
of national AI solutions and look to establish the security 
requirements, both physical and cyber, to safeguard 
national and public security from inherent threats, hazards 
and vulnerabilities.
