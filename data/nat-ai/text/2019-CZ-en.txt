National Artificial Intelligence 
Strategy of the Czech Republic
The Czech Republic is a country of ingenious people. It is these people that we must build our future prosperity on. 
The Government has committed itself to becoming one of Europe’s innovative leaders and a country of the techno-
logical future within twelve years. The National AI Strategy you are holding in your hands is one of the important 
steps towards this objective. Artificial intelligence, which includes smart programs and various machines from robots 
in factories, through algorithms in banks, to self-driving cars in the streets, is the future. And the Czech Republic wants 
to play an important role in it.
We have all the requisites to do so – extraordinary scientists and developers, we are a technology-oriented country 
and we meet the most stringent economic criteria. We have decided to set out on an ambitious path, which requires 
both the State and businesses to engage investment, resources, data, and, above all, cooperation to retrain staff to 
develop standards and international partnerships. The very word robot was coined by the Czech writer Karel Čapek 
in 1920. Already then, it meant more than mere mechanical machines – an entirely new form of technology and so-
ciety. In 21st century, software robots have a significant role. Already those robots are giving rise to issues of safety, 
ethical values and risks of abuse. Successful resolution of those issues is our national priority.
Safe and responsible AI
ČThe Czech Republic has great potential to contribute to the prosperity and competitiveness of the EU as a whole. 
Our best traditions are in industry, defence and security. We are the sixth safest country in the world, and our com-
panies and developers have also succeeded in the area of protection from cyber attacks. We are a safe cyber port 
in the heart of Europe. Therefore, our ambition is to become the centre of collaboration of the best scientists and 
developers in these areas and to join the European efforts in the development of artificial intelligence, with man in its 
centre. We want AI to be not only credible, but above all safe and responsible.
We are going to ensure the safety of driverless cars, robots and autonomous weapons, simply wherever man and 
intelligent machine meet. We are going to build on our past achievements in mobility and transport, military and 
security research as well as our historical experience. We are going to focus on protecting every person and con-
sumer, their rights and privacy, especially the weakest ones. We are going to prevent discrimination, manipulation 
and misuse of AI, we are going to set the rules for decision-making of algorithms about people in everyday life. We 
want artificial intelligence to serve all the people of Europe.
Model country for Europe
However, by combining our industrial traditions, research facilities and entrepreneurial skills, we can achieve much 
more. In 2020 – 100 years since the word Robot was first used – we want to build AI research centres of European 
importance, and we want to be the model country for the whole of Europe in automation before the Czech Republic’s 
presidency of the EU Council in 2022. Our future economic performance will depend on the focus on final manu-
facturing, technological solutions and services, which are essential for value added and profits. Digital transforma-
tion of the economy through artificial intelligence is a huge opportunity for us, and we especially need to support 
small and medium-sized businesses, start-ups and domestic brands. We want to be a country where new European 
champions, the new Baťas, emerge and which is appealing to foreign investors not for the low prices, but because of 
cutting-edge research, skilled workforce and friendly and predictable legislation. 
This is the best time for us to make bold changes – we are among the most stable economies, our businesses achieve 
unprecedented results, and our scientists are gaining increasing respect in the world. While everyone is afraid of 
robots and labour market turmoil today, we are going to embrace them. We will help all employees and self-em-
ployed persons with retraining and acquiring new skills. We will ensure that no one is left behind, everyone is given 
the chance to succeed and that everyone has a share in the benefits of the breakthrough technology. 
We have the highest ambitions and we are fully committed to fulfilling them. We gave the world the word robot and 
we have nothing to worry about at the time of robots. We have hard work ahead of us, but I am convinced that to-
gether we are going to get our country back to where it once belonged.

Prime Minister of the Czech Republic
VISION – Czech Republic, the country of robots
The Czech Republic and the European Union are fully aware of the fundamental importance of artificial intelligence 
(AI) and its use for the future development and competitiveness of national, European and global economies and 
societies. The National Artificial Intelligence Strategy of the Czech Republic (hereinafter the “National AI Strategy”, 
“Strategy” or “NAIS”) is therefore primarily aimed at building on the activities and strategic documents of the EU 
and achieving the full potential of digital transformation. To do so, it sets out a framework of priority objectives and 
tools to support AI development in the academic, public and private sectors, mutual cooperation and international 
engagement, which the Czech Republic has committed itself to in the Declaration of Cooperation on Artificial Intel-
ligence signed on 10th April 2018. The National AI Strategy follows up on and meets the objectives of the Govern-
ment Innovation Strategy 2019–2030 and is linked to the Digital Czech Republic programme. It was inspired by 
similar foreign strategic documents concerning the AI and support for the digitization of the industry and services.
The strategy was prepared in close cooperation with the Ministry of Industry and Trade, as the main coordinator, 
with public, private and research institutions, the general public and with the involvement of social partners. Deputy 
Prime Minister and the Minister of Industry and Trade is directly responsible for its implementation and will coordinate 
it through the newly established AI Committee (a subcommittee under the Committee for the Digital Economy and 
Society strategy), which primarily includes responsible ministries and whose operational management will be con-
tinuously ensured by the Executive Committee. The specific procedural tools and tasks for implementing the overall 
strategy coordination are summarized in the introduction to the strategy, under the heading “tools and tasks”. 
NAIS is based on the assumption that current trends in artificial intelligence, automation, robotics, and the related 
fields such as electromobility, data economy or 5G networks, are crucial for the further development of industry, 
services and the economy as a whole. The main horizontal objectives of the Strategy are therefore to use these 
state-of-the-art technologies to help the Czech Republic to become an innovative economy and to support domestic 
companies and brands and further economic growth. Strengthen the safety and security of the population, increase 
their comfort in everyday life and ensure fast, efficient and helpful communication with the State. The overall objective 
is to make the Czech Republic again one of the world’s most advanced countries.
The Strategy is vertically divided into seven chapters, according to the priority areas of development of artificial intel-
ligence and their impacts. Each of them contains a summary of the current situation, based primarily on the Research 
Report on the AI Potential in the Czech Republic and the mapping performed by the AI Platform of the Confederation 
of Industry. These result in specific objectives in the short, medium and long term and tools to achieve them. The objec-
tives are timed mainly in relation to the EU financial framework, they will be linked to the Implementation Plans of the 
Digital Economy and Society strategy and formulated as specific measures that can be implemented within a given 
time frame. The tools are cross-sectional for each chapter and do not have an implementation date. Each chapter lists 
not only the responsible State administration body as the coordinator, but also the co-coordinator usually co-operat-
ing with it, and other entities whose work it will coordinate for the given priority area. The objectives and tools will be 
reviewed after each time period. The objectives and tools contained in this Strategy do not interfere with or replace 
the applicable sectoral strategies of the respective coordinators, so this Strategy does not interfere with the division 
of coordination responsibilities among the different ministries in the sense of the Competencies Act. On the contrary, 
the purpose is to connect the responsible coordinators and co-coordinators for effective cooperation in achieving the 
objectives and effective overall coordination of this Strategy.
The key to fulfil the National AI Strategy is primarily to support the concentration of excellent R&D in AI, in particular 
by supporting the creation of the European Centre of Excellence, Test Centre and Digital Innovation Hubs. The Strat-
egy will also be fulfilled by deepening cooperation with global AI centres, but also by maintaining top research and 
experts in the Czech Republic and, conversely, by simplifying and attracting conditions for the arrival of top foreign 
talent.  (Chapter 1). It is therefore essential to ensure funding for research, the development of start-ups, the entire AI 
ecosystem, the transfer of know-how and the availability of resources for innovation of SMEs ( Chapter 2). The driv-
ing force behind digital and AI transformation is the economy and it is therefore necessary to create conditions for 
its development. The State can contribute to this mainly by making available data, completing digital infrastructure, 
supporting the transformation of enterprises and introducing modern public administration services (Chapter 3). 
Introduction – How to read this strategy
Education, training and retraining, both technical and humanitarian, will play a crucial role, targeting the skills need-
ed in the next decade (Chapter 4). The training of human capital will be key to the effects of AI and automation on 
the labour market and employment, but especially the social system will also have to respond quickly and flexibly 
(Chapter 5). A significant role in development will also be played by clear legislation, ensuring the protection of 
fundamental rights and security as well as legal certainty for investors (Chapter 6). An irreplaceable role in the use 
of global trends is played by the international cooperation and involvement of the Czech Republic, especially at EU 
level (Chapter 7).
In the above-mentioned areas and in order to promote economic growth and competitiveness, public authorities 
need to become actively involved. Above all, however, they will need to do this in close cooperation with the private 
sector, which is without prejudice to other activities in this area, which we welcome. It is the cooperation of all the en-
tities involved that is crucial for the real fulfilment of the National AI Strategy and successful handling of fundamental 
changes for the Czech economy and society.

The National AI Strategy builds and follows up on existing key strategies at both European and national levels. 
1. European Union
At European level, the basic documents are “Artificial Intelligence for Europe” and the Coordinated Plan on 
Artificial Intelligence (hereinafter the “Coordinated Plan”) issued by the European Commission in December 2018. 
This Coordinated Plan sets out the European Union’s strategic objectives and priorities for artificial intelligence. It 
is a European umbrella strategy for AI, which was developed in cooperation with Member States, and calls on 
Member States to implement the Coordinated Plan at national level. For this reason, the strategy builds on the 
structure of the Coordinated Plan, while at the same time modifying the objectives and headings (six areas in total 
plus international coordination, see below) so that the Czech Republic can take advantage of the financial and 
administrative support that the EU will provide to the Member States under the tools available by Digital Europe 
and Horizon Europe in the upcoming programming period 2021–2027.
Member States are to submit national AI Strategies by mid-2019 at the latest (i.e. by the end of June 2019), includ-
ing the setting of investment measures and implementation plans. At the same time, the Council of the European 
Union endorsed the Coordinated Plan by its conclusions of 11 February 2019, thus formally endorsing the European 
approach to addressing and coordinating artificial intelligence. The Strategy therefore implements this European 
approach.
2. Digital Czech Republic
At national level, the Strategy complements and builds on, in particular, two major government strategies for dig-
itization and innovation. The Strategy is linked to Digital Economy and Society (hereinafter the “DES”), which is a 
strategy forming one of the three pillars of the government’s programme Digital Czech Republic. In its sub-objec-
tives, the DES clearly sets out specific tasks and areas for the elaboration of implementation plans in the field of 
artificial intelligence. These sub-objectives are in particular: 1.6 “Active involvement of the Czech Republic in the 
EU Initiative on Artificial Intelligence”, 2.1 “Support for the Development of Artificial Intelligence”, 6.4 “Ensuring a 
Consistent Approach and Implementation of Legislation” and 8.3 “Two-way link of programmes and coordination 
of the strategy Digital Economy and Society and initiatives based on the pillar Czech Republic in digital Europe”.
3. Innovation Strategy of the Czech Republic
In addition, the Strategy follows up on and supports the Innovation Strategy of the Czech Republic 2019–2030, 
especially its part Digital State, production and services, where one of the main tools is the Coordinated Plan and 
the National AI Strategy. 
At the same time, the strategy is based on the study “Research of the potential for the Development of Artificial 
Intelligence in the Czech Republic” (hereinafter the “AI Analysis”), which is the model for this Strategy and which 
the government acknowledged and at the same time imposed on the Ministry of Industry and Trade the develop-
ment of a National Artificial Intelligence Strategy of the Czech Republic.
At the same time, the strategy will be taken into account in all other sectoral government documents that address 
strategic solutions and practices in the digital economy and are linked to artificial intelligence. This applies mainly 
to the National RIS3 Strategy.

1.1 Responsibility
Coordinator: Ministry of Industry and Trade  
Co-coordinator: Council for Research, Development, and Innovation
1.2 Baseline:  
In the field of artificial intelligence, the Czech Republic has a comparative advantage in excellent research and 
development, both in primary and applied research. There are thousands of researchers in AI and closely related 
fields. Czech universities also produce more than a hundred experts in the AI area annually, which is more than 
some of the world’s renowned AI centres.  In order to realize this potential, it is not only necessary to further devel-
op scientific and research capacity in academia and business and to strengthen cooperation with the private sec-
tor, but also to concentrate it significantly. The key factor is attracting top talent and transferring results into practice, 
enabling substantial support for non-specific advanced research and innovation. The key is to build a European 
Centre of Excellence in AI research, the European Test Centre and Digital Innovation Hubs, which are one of the 
priorities of the National AI Strategy.
1.3.1. Short-term objectives (until 2021):
• Establishment of a European Centre of Excellence in AI based on a consortium of academic research institutes 
based in Prague under direct coordination of the Ministry of Industry and Trade and in collaboration with other 
V4 national research centres and partners and the Central European region.

2.2 Baseline:
Setting up favourable conditions for investment and cooperation with foreign entities for the development of an AI 
ecosystem, together with the support of science, research and development, is a key part of utilizing the potential 
of artificial intelligence in the Czech Republic. Excellent research in academia and business requires financial and 
non-financial support and coordination at the highest level to maximize efficiency. Today, even in the fast-paced 
and popular AI market, start-ups can face challenges in getting the right funding allowing them to expand global-
ly. Small and medium-sized enterprises whose their development and shift to high-value production will underpin 
future prosperity, employment and economic growth, will face increasing funding and investment demands with 
the progress of automation. A strong capital market then promotes economic development through efficient cap-
ital allocation, which can also be used to create jobs with higher added value and lower risk due to automation,

3.1 Responsibility
Coordinator: Ministry of Industry and Trade 
Co-coordinator: AI Platform of the Confederation of Industry of the Czech Republic
3.2 Baseline: 
The Czech Republic is one of the most industrialized countries with almost 40% share of value added in the econo-
my. Of this, more than a fifth of the production goes to the automotive sector. As a result, the advent of AI, automa-
tion and massive robotics can become a source of uncertainty for businesses, their business models and the econ-
omy. The companies will have to undergo internal transformation of their structure, organization of production and 
use of employees, as well as partners and customer-supply chains. In the event of a global race for technological 
dominance, Europe and the Czech Republic, coupled with the German industrial cluster, risk losing up to half the 
added value, especially in the automotive industry. But the digital and AI transformation of the economy will even 
more affect the service sector. The Czech Republic’s industrial, economic and technological position will therefore 
be crucial for the future growth of the economy and living standards in the coming ground-breaking period. At the 
same time, artificial intelligence can be a key engine that will enable us to move up the value chain and encourage 
the emergence of strong new national champions as well as the successful development of existing businesses. AI 
can also be the engine of its own disruptive innovations, which can significantly strengthen the Czech economy. 
Furthermore, the aim is to market our own disruptive advantages before competition. Therefore, it is essential to use 
and transfer the knowledge from cutting-edge research into business practice, support automation in companies, 
especially small and medium-sized enterprises, and closely related issues of qualified and retrained workforce. 
The main objective is to increase not only the competitiveness of the Czech Republic, but the whole region and 
Europe, and attention should also be paid to the development of such AI solutions that have high application po-
tential through the use of knowledge from other vertical sectors (e.g. automotive, mobility, aviation). In this respect, 
State intervention is justifiable and desirable, especially in terms of creating business conditions and building the 
necessary infrastructure and getting the maximum part of the value chain in parts with high added value. The basic 
prerequisite is to make available a sufficient data base while preserving the privacy and other rights of stakehold-
ers to build a data-based economy.
3.3.1. Short-term objectives (until 2021):
• Accelerating adoption of existing disruptive technologies and engaging AI tools in the corporate environment, 
with a particular focus on supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, especially those with high synergy 
effects.
• Creating a continually updated map of all players in AI industry and services.
• Analysis of the position of the Czech Republic in the field of technological development of artificial intelligence 
and its applications in the business sector, including the network industries of transport, telecommunications 
and energy.
• Promotion and assistance in the use of existing projects of economic migration (Fast Track and Welcome 
Package projects), and using the option to grant permanent residence in the interest of the Czech Republic.
• Within the upcoming government programmes (a key and highly qualified employee), allow for accelerated 
and simplified acquisition of residence and work permits for experts, highly skilled workers and their family 
members.
3. AI in industry, services and public administration, economic growth, 
growth of wages and overall competitiveness of the Czech Republic

4. Human capital and the education system together with lifelong learning 
4.1 Responsibility
Coordinator:  Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports
Co-coordinator: Council of Economic and Social Agreement
4.2 Baseline: 
Education plays a crucial role in the transformation of the economy and society brought about by artificial intelli-
gence. In order to minimize the potential negative impacts and, on the other hand, to fully exploit the opportunities 
offered, it will be necessary not only to adapt the whole education system, but also to focus on lifelong learning 
and retraining directly with employers for the development of human capital. According to the Research Report of 
AI Potential in the Czech Republic, a part of mainly routine skills will be substitutable with technologies, affecting 
1.3 million Czech employees within 5 years, 2.2 million Czech employees within 15 years and almost 3.4 million 
Czech employees within 30 years. It is therefore essential to focus on skills development that will not be replaced 
by automation and, on the contrary, develop unique skills that can be used in high value-added positions. At the 
same time, complex skills, multidisciplinarity and IT thinking are becoming more important. Due to the dynamics 
of changes, the education system must also be flexible enough to focus on developing the knowledge and skills 
that can be used on the future rather than the current labour market. At present it shows only insufficient fulfilment 
of the conditions for the inclusion of digital technologies in education and the overall development of this area in 
educational processes. Pupils do not achieve the expected results in the field of IT thinking, most teachers perceive 
the use of information technology as a supplement to classical teaching, not as a fundamental factor in its transfor-
mation. Mathematical literacy is then very often negatively related to the subject’s low popularity with pupils. Thus, 
the whole Czech education system faces a very important and challenging task, and for its successful fulfilment it 
is necessary to allocate sufficient resources and give it the highest priority. Close cooperation between the public 
and private sectors, especially educational institutions, employers and non-governmental organizations, as well 
as international cooperation and the adoption of good practice examples, are essential. New strategic documents 
for education in the post-2020 period offer an opportunity for its transformation.
4.3.1. Short-term objectives (until 2021):

5.1 Responsibility
Coordinator: Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs
Co-coordinator: Council of Economic and Social Agreement
5.2 Baseline:
The greatest impacts of the AI on the economy are generally expected through automation and replacement of 
routine and repeatable (even laborious) work by machines. Thus, human capacity should be liberated for more 
creative, value-added work and, overall, performance, productivity, quality and efficiency should be increased. 
At the same time, automation is a way to compensate for the lack of labour due to unfavourable demographic 
developments in developed countries. Therefore, there is likely no risk of a total loss of jobs, because the lost ones 
should be compensated by the emergence of new jobs. However, it will be necessary to undergo a successful 
transformation at the level of the whole economy, sectors and individuals, which can impose a considerable bur-
den not only on the educational, but also on the social system and bring about many negative consequences if it 
is not properly managed. In most cases, retraining of workers for which sufficient support, will be needed to move 
to the same or better jobs, while the extent and speed of finding a new job is largely individual. Potential threats 
include deepening the problems in socially excluded regions, temporarily increasing structural and frictional un-
employment, or deepening the various forms of inequality and discrimination. The effects of automation are likely 
to be different for different population groups, with the middle class being among the most affected groups. The 
impacts can thus be not only purely economic, but also social and political. We are also very likely to see a change 
in FTEs, the emergence of new forms of work and the expansion of outsourcing, to which we will need to respond 
flexibly and consider the use of innovative approaches and their practical verification. Given the unpredictability 
of the changes, it will be crucial to first prepare the appropriate tools that can be used operatively in the event of 
disruption in the labour market due to AI and automation. these will be based on the measures under the Work 4.0 
Action Plan and the fulfilment of the objectives of the Digital Czech Republic strategy.

Coordinator: Office of the Government of the Czech Republic 
Co-coordinator: Institute of State and Law of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic
6.2 Baseline:
In areas affecting global trends, such as artificial intelligence, the development of the Czech legal system largely 
depends on the activities of transnational and international entities of which the Czech Republic is a member. The 
most important influence is that of the European Union law, which has set strategic goals in the field of AI, includ-
ing the creation of Ethical Guidelines for the Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence and the creation of an 
innovation-friendly legal framework. Other international organizations, notably the OECD, the WTO, the UN and 
the Council of Europe, also have significant activity in this field. In addition to binding international documents, 
these organizations also provide regulatory guidance through non-binding model laws and recommendations. 
Similarly, a number of private sector documents are being produced, especially in the form of self-regulatory codes 
and other forms of soft-law. In order to develop and fully exploit the potential of the AI in the Czech Republic, it is 
necessary, first of all, to respond flexibly and continuously to the development of technologies by setting up friendly 
research and development legislation, as well as emerging economic models, removing obstacles and, conversely, 
setting legal certainty. All this while maintaining a high level of protection of fundamental and other rights and in 
line with the European approach of human-centric AI.
6.3.1. Short-term objectives (until 2021):
• Identify specific legislative barriers to research, development and use of AI in each sector.
• Preparation of an analysis of Czech legal regulations and implementation of European principles of liability for 
damage in relation to AI, especially for the operation of autonomous and collaborative systems and for phas-
es of experimental and live operation with special emphasis on continuously self-learning systems, including 
possible introduction of compulsory insurance.
• Establishment of an expert platform and forum for continuous monitoring of legal and ethical rules and in-
struments at national and international level in light of current needs for research, development and use of AI 
organized in cooperation with the Institute of State and Law of the ASCR.
• A public consultation, including an interactive questionnaire, on the basic legal issues associated with the 
protection of rights to intellectual property items created by AI and the legal certainty, including Ethical recom-
mendations for the development and utilisation of artificial intelligence.

development in AI and horizontal (cross-sectoral) analysis of specific data access legislation. On that basis, an 
analysis and public consultation of proposals for possible solutions (e.g. the data trust model) in the environ-
ment of Czech law, including the legislative proposals for changes and their approval.
• Public consultation on data ownership and disclosure and GDPR application principles, including an analysis 
of GDPR adaptation law in relation to AI.
• Preparation of a risk analysis of existing personality protection, privacy protection and data protection in re-
lation to AI.

7.2 Baseline:  
Artificial intelligence appears in all current debates at national and international level that are related to the devel-
opment of the economy and society. AI was one of the most discussed issues in 2018 also in the European Union 
and the theme resonates in international organizations. Horizontal projects are being developed within the OECD. 
As with the EU, the OECD is establishing its own AI Policy Observatory on monitoring and collecting relevant 
 policy documents and promoting collaboration between different interest groups. The theme also appears at many 
AI-focused meetings (The AI Summit, World Summit AI, AI Forum 2018 and others), as well as at major annual 
conferences (e.g. the World Economic Forum). It can be expected that in the coming years it will play a crucial 
role in the various activities and programmes of international institutions and in bilateral and multilateral relations 
between States. It is therefore a great opportunity to become an active and strong player on the international scene 
with a clear position and clear priorities. The Czech Republic takes over the V4 presidency in July 2019, and AI will 
be one of the key topics of V4 strategic cooperation.

Private sector
In the Czech Republic, according to the expectations of experts, there are hundreds of entities conducting ap-
plied research in the field of artificial intelligence. Dozens of private institutions are involved in basic AI research. 
According to the initial evaluation of the mapping of the corporate AI environment, carried out by the Confederation 
of Industry of the Czech Republic, analytical conclusions were drawn showing the distribution between individual 
application methods, sectors and areas. The mapping was done so that the National Strategy could be based on 
real data and knowledge from practice. Therefore, we collected quantitative data on research, development and 
production of algorithms and software for AI, but also on the use of AI in the Czech Republic. The mapping will 
continue and will be evaluated on a regular basis. The numbers were rounded according to rounding rules to make 
the results as accurate as possible. The members of the Confederation of Industry of the Czech Republic, all other 
member associations and organizations and the general public were approached for the purpose of mapping – in 
total thousands of entities were approached, of which 50 companies decided to become involved at this stage.
